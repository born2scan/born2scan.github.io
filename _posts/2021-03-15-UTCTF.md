## Small P Problems

The first hint is given by the subjects' names: Whitfield and Martin are indeed Whitfield _Diffie_ and Martin _Hellman_.

We have `p` and `g` (the modulus and the generator of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol) and we also have `A` and `B`, which are

```text
A = g^a (mod p)
B = g^b (mod p)
```

where `a` and `b` are two random secret numbers.

The shared secret is calculated as follows:

```text
s = g^(a * b) (mod p) = A^b (mod p) = B^a (mod p)
```

Our goal is to find `a` such that `g^a (mod p) = A` (or `b` such that `g^b (mod p) = B`) --- mathematically speaking, we have to solve the discrete logarithm problem.
Once `a` is found, calculating `s` is trivial.

In this context we have a very small `p` (hence the name of the challenge!), so we can find `a` via a bruteforce attack with very little effort.

```py
p = 69691
g = 1001

A = 17016
B = 47643

a = 1
guess = None
while guess != A:
    a += 1
    guess = pow(g, a, p)

s = pow(B, a, p)
print(s)
```

Wrapping the number we have our flag!

## Illegal Prime

> The NSA published the ciphertext from a one-time-pad. Since breaking one-time-pad is so easy, I did it for you.
>
> To avoid legal trouble I can't tell you the key. On an unrelated note I found this really cool [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).

We are given a text file with the following content:

```text
c = 2f7f63b5e27343dcf750bf83fb4893fe3b20a87e81e6fb62c33d30

p = 56594044391339477686029513026021974392498922525513994709310909529135745009448534622250639333011770158535778535848522177601610597930145120019374953248865595853915254057748042248348224821499113613633807994411737092129239655022633988633736058693251230631716531822464530907151
```

We can presume that `c` is the ciphertext, and `p` is the prime number.
The link in the prompt refers to the Wikipedia page about _illegal primes_, prime numbers that are considered illegal in some jurisdictions because they are the numeric representation of some piece of illegal software.

So if we try and interpret the number `p` as a byte array, it is indeed the numeric representation of the (padded) string `k = 5a0b05...` which really looks like our key!

Now we can easily decrypt the ciphertext as follows:

```py
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

c = bytes.fromhex('2f7f63b5e27343dcf750bf83fb4893fe3b20a87e81e6fb62c33d30')

p = 56594044391339477686029513026021974392498922525513994709310909529135745009448534622250639333011770158535778535848522177601610597930145120019374953248865595853915254057748042248348224821499113613633807994411737092129239655022633988633736058693251230631716531822464530907151
k = bytes.fromhex(long_to_bytes(p).decode('ascii').strip('\x00\x0f').split(' = ')[1])

plain = ''
for i, encrypted_char in enumerate(c):
    plain += chr(encrypted_char ^ k[i])

print(plain)
```

And here's our flag!

## Be My Guest

Such an explicit scanning permission needs to be acted upon, and while we're at it let's enable some version detection too:

```bash
nmap -sV -T4 -p 8881-8882 misc.utctf.live
```

```text
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
8881/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
8882/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
```

[Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) shares in a challenge with "guest" in its name? Anonymous credentials are worth try:

```bash
smbclient -U anonymous%anonymous -p 8881 -L misc.utctf.live
```

```text
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
guest           Disk      Look, but don't touch please.
IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server)
```

Let's browse the share's contents:

```bash
smbclient -p 8881 -U anonymous%anonymous \\\\misc.utctf.live\\guest
```

```text
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Fri Mar 12 07:45:26 2021

  flag.txt                            N       30  Fri Mar 12 07:45:26 2021

## Hack Bob's Box

> Hack Bob's box!
>
> nmap is allowed for this problem only. However, you may only target utctf.live:8121 and utctf.live:8122 with nmap.

Like before, let's poke at the thing and try some slightly more aggressive version detection:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p 8121-8122 misc.utctf.live
```

```text
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8121/tcp open  ftp     Pure-FTPd

Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux\_kernel
```

After a few tries with `lftp` and `ftp`, it's confirmed that the FTP server is returning an unroutable (internal) IP address when enabling passive mode. Active mode won't get us anywhere and trying to manually override the `PORT` command gets ignored by the server, which always returns a random port on `172.19.0.2`.

At this point my hypothesis was that, since the OpenSSH server version was quite old, maybe some known CVE could be used to exploit it and get access to the internal network. Then we could tap into the FTP server's passive mode session and dump the received data. After _a lot_ of fiddling, out of the blue the FTP server actually started behaving correctly and let us in with anonymous credentials. Maybe it was misconfigured at the start of the CTF and someone fixed it later on? Anyway:

```bash
lftp anonymous:anonymous@misc.utctf.live:8121
```

```text

```

An SSH key is readable, but since the `authorized_keys` file is empty we can safely assume that it can't be used to log in. Too bad, what else is in here? It seems that `.mozilla/firefox/yu85tipn.bob/` contains Bob's Firefox profile, let's pull it down and inspect it.

```bash
lftp anonymous@misc.utctf.live:/> mirror .mozilla/firefox/yu85tipn.bob
```

Not knowing if the contents of the profile are safe, I chose to run it through [firefed](https://github.com/numirias/firefed) instead. No extensions, no relevant bookmarks, some tracking cookies, no saved logins... but some interesting history! As a bonus, it seems that Bob is interested in either animals or Nintendo emulators 🐬

```bash
firefed -p yu85tipn.bob visits

#...
2021-03-02 18:20:55 http://bobsite.com/login?user=bob&pass=i-l0v3-d0lph1n5
```

Aha! SSL might protect your queries (well, not in this case...), but it can't save you from the dreaded _browser history_.

```bash
sshpass -p "i-l0v3-d0lph1n5" ssh -p 8122 bob@misc.utctf.live

bob@ab405b7be269:~$
```

Let's abuse the server's resources for a moment since we're lazy and don't want to poke around too much:

```bash
bob@ab405b7be269:~$ find / -type f -iname "*flag*" 2>/dev/null

#...
/flag.txt
```

## SHIFT

![SHIFT](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/SHIFT.png)

This challenge was retrospectively quite funny: the [official solution](https://github.com/utisss/UTCTF-21/tree/8b16745892370f3e683f8f6189f436672dd626e7/forensics-shifted-image) involves Python, PIL, numpy, some trial end error... But some really basic GIMP knowledge would have served you quite well too.

## Emoji Encryption

> I came up with this rad new encryption. Bet no one can break it
>
> ```text
> ☂️🦃🔥🦁🍎🎸{🐘🥭🧅🤹🧊☀️_💣🐘_🌋🐘🌈☀️🍎🦃🧊🦁🐘}
> ```

We are given a series of emojis, curly brackets and underscores. Those are aranged in a way such that it's pretty easy to recognize a flag disguised as a sequence of emojis. It's also intuitive to recognize that every letter of the flag is encoded with an emoji that rapresents an animal/object which has as first letter of its name as the above-mentioned letter.
In order to decrypt the flag, the only thing we have to do is to replace every emoji with the first letter of its name (for clarity's sake I've substituted every emoji with it's name and capitalized and bolded the first letter):
