## Small P Problems

> My buddies Whitfield and Martin were trying to share a secret key between themselves, and I was able to eavesdrop on their conversation. I bet I could probably figure out their shared secret with a little math...

The first hint is given by the subjects' names: Whitfield and Martin are indeed Whitfield _Diffie_ and Martin _Hellman_.

We have `p` and `g` (the modulus and the generator of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol) and we also have `A` and `B`, which are:

$$
\displaylines{
A \equiv g^a \pmod{p} \\
B \equiv g^b \pmod{p}
}
$$

where `a` and `b` are two random secret numbers.

The shared secret is calculated as follows:

$$
s \equiv g^{(a*b)} \equiv A^b \equiv B^a \pmod{p}
$$

Our goal is to find `a` such that $g^{\large a} \pmod{p} = a$ (or `b` such that $g^{\large b} \pmod{p} = B$) --- mathematically speaking, we have to solve the discrete logarithm problem.
Once `a` is found, calculating `s` is trivial.

In this context we have a very small `p` (hence the name of the challenge!), so we can find `a` via a bruteforce attack with very little effort.

```py
p = 69691
g = 1001

A = 17016
B = 47643

a = 1
guess = None
while guess != A:
    a += 1
    guess = pow(g, a, p)

s = pow(B, a, p)
print(s)
```

Wrapping the number we have our flag!

## Illegal Prime

> The NSA published the ciphertext from a one-time-pad. Since breaking one-time-pad is so easy, I did it for you.
>
> To avoid legal trouble I can't tell you the key. On an unrelated note I found this really cool [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).

We are given a text file with the following content:

```text
c = 2f7f63b5e27343dcf750bf83fb4893fe3b20a87e81e6fb62c33d30

p = 56594044391339477686029513026021974392498922525513994709310909529135745009448534622250639333011770158535778535848522177601610597930145120019374953248865595853915254057748042248348224821499113613633807994411737092129239655022633988633736058693251230631716531822464530907151
```

We can presume that `c` is the ciphertext, and `p` is the prime number.
The link in the prompt refers to the Wikipedia page about _illegal primes_, prime numbers that are considered illegal in some jurisdictions because they are the numeric representation of some piece of illegal software.

So if we try and interpret the number `p` as a byte array, it is indeed the numeric representation of the (padded) string `k = 5a0b05...` which really looks like our key!

Now we can easily decrypt the ciphertext as follows:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

c = bytes.fromhex('2f7f63b5e27343dcf750bf83fb4893fe3b20a87e81e6fb62c33d30')

p = 56594044391339477686029513026021974392498922525513994709310909529135745009448534622250639333011770158535778535848522177601610597930145120019374953248865595853915254057748042248348224821499113613633807994411737092129239655022633988633736058693251230631716531822464530907151
k = bytes.fromhex(long_to_bytes(p).decode('ascii').strip('\x00\x0f').split(' = ')[1])

plain = ''
for i, encrypted_char in enumerate(c):
    plain += chr(encrypted_char ^ k[i])

print(plain)
```

And here's our flag!

## Prove No Knowledge

> I've been trying to authenticate to this service, but I'm lacking enough information.
>
> nc crypto.utctf.live 4354

Upon connection, we are greeted by an authentication system that will let us pass only after authenticating for 256 rounds.

Given only 3 numbers `g`, `p` and `y`, to authenticate one must prove knowledge of `x` such that $g^x \equiv y \pmod{p}$.

Each round we pick an `r`, send $g^{\large r} \pmod{p}$ and then send either `r` or `(x+r) mod (p-1)`. Since the starting values, for some misterious reason, never change, we only need to figure out the answer to both question once and send the same right answers repeatedly.

Before diving into the math, looking up the name of the challenge revealed that this is a well-known authentication method, known as [Zero Knowledge Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Discrete_log_of_a_given_value).

ZKP it's a challenge and response method to prove knowledge of information without revealing it, based on probability. There are two possible question, one where the answer is trivially easy and therefore always known, and the other one is known only if in possess of the secret. Asking this questions randomly multiple times reduces the probability of a cheating Peggy. The tipical practical example is through the use of **discrete logarithms**.

Peggy knows a value `x` and wants to prove it to Victor without revealing it.

1) Peggy randomly pick `r` in the range of the group and send $C = g^r \pmod{p}$<br>
2) Victor ask one of two questions:

2.a) To send `r` and this could be simply verified

2.b) To send $(x+r)\bmod{(p-1)}$ and verifying as follows:

$$(C\cdot y)\ {\bmod\ p} \equiv g^{(x+r)\ {\bmod\ {(p-1)}}}\ {\bmod\ p}$$

Summing up, we the verifiers, should not be in control of `r`.

![not a good idea](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/good_idea.gif)

_"Not at all, Roy"_, crafting $C = (g^{x})^{-1}$:

$$
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
    (C \cdot y) \equiv g^{(x+r)\ {\bmod\ {(p-1)}}} {\pmod{p}} \\
    ((g^{x})^{-1} \cdot (g^{x})) \equiv g^{(x+r)\ {\bmod\ {(p-1)}}} {\pmod{p}} \\
    1 \equiv g^{(x+r)\ {\bmod\ {(p-1)}}} {\pmod{p}}
\end{align}
}
$$

and when asked for $(x+r)\ {\bmod {(p-1)}}$ , sending `0` will do the trick.

Such an explicit scanning permission needs to be acted upon, and while we're at it let's enable some version detection too:

```bash
nmap -sV -T4 -p 8881-8882 misc.utctf.live
```

```

[Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) shares in a challenge with "guest" in its name? Anonymous credentials are worth try:

```bash
smbclient -U anonymous%anonymous -p 8881 -L misc.utctf.live
```

```text

Let's browse the share's contents:

```bash

## Hack Bob's Box

> nmap is allowed for this problem only. However, you may only target utctf.live:8121 and utctf.live:8122 with nmap.

Like before, let's poke at the thing and try some slightly more aggressive version detection:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p 8121-8122 misc.utctf.live
```

```text

```

After a few tries with `lftp` and `ftp`, it's confirmed that the FTP server is returning an unroutable (internal) IP address when enabling passive mode. Active mode won't get us anywhere and trying to manually override the `PORT` command gets ignored by the server, which always returns a random port on `172.19.0.2`.

At this point my hypothesis was that, since the OpenSSH server version was quite old, maybe some known CVE could be used to exploit it and get access to the internal network. Then we could tap into the FTP server's passive mode session and dump the received data. After _a lot_ of fiddling, out of the blue the FTP server actually started behaving correctly and let us in with anonymous credentials. Maybe it was misconfigured at the start of the CTF and someone fixed it later on? Anyway:

```bash
lftp anonymous:anonymous@misc.utctf.live:8121
```

An SSH key is readable, but since the `authorized_keys` file is empty we can safely assume that it can't be used to log in. Too bad, what else is in here? It seems that `.mozilla/firefox/yu85tipn.bob/` contains Bob's Firefox profile, let's pull it down and inspect it.

```bash
lftp anonymous@misc.utctf.live:/> mirror .mozilla/firefox/yu85tipn.bob
```

Not knowing if the contents of the profile are safe, I chose to run it through [firefed](https://github.com/numirias/firefed) instead. No extensions, no relevant bookmarks, some tracking cookies, no saved logins... but some interesting history! As a bonus, it seems that Bob is interested in either animals or Nintendo emulators 🐬

```bash

```bash
sshpass -p "i-l0v3-d0lph1n5" ssh -p 8122 bob@misc.utctf.live

## Recur

>I found this binary that is supposed to print flags.
>
>It doesn't seem to work properly though...

In this challenge we are given the ELF 64-bit file "recur". If we execute the file it print "utflag{" and then unfortunately it freezes. Let's try to take a look at the decompiled code obtained with Ghidra in order to understand the problem:

![main](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/main.png)

This the main of the program. We can see that is executed only a cycle of 28 iteractions, in which the flag, located in the .data section of the file, is "decrypted" with a function named recurrence followed by a XOR. Let's see what this function consists of:

![recurrence](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/rec.png)

The function appears to be correct in the syntax, so problably the program freezes because the recurrence it's too complex to compute in terms of numbers dimension and recursive calls. Maybe we can try to optimize the code of the recurrence so that it ends and we get our flag. Firstly we can notice that the only part of the value returned by the recurrence that we are going to use is one byte; so we can avoid complex calculations considering only one byte of that value. 
Then we can implement a way to store results that we already calculated. The recursive calls from `recurrence(n)` are indeed of the type `recurrence(n-1)` and `recurrence(n-2)`, so the same functions are called a lot of times during the execution. Let's try to rewrite the recurrence function with these optimizations in python:

```python
def recurrence(x, table):
    if table[x] != -1:
        return table[x]
    elif x == 0:
        v1 = 3
    elif x == 1:
        v1 = 5
    else:
        v1 = recurrence(x - 1, table) & 255
        v2 = recurrence(x - 2, table) & 255
        v1 = (int(v2) * 3 + int(v1) * 2) & 255
    # print(v1)
    if table[x] == -1:
        table[x] = v1
    return v1


res = []
table = [-1] * 28 * 28
flag = [0x76, 0x71, 0xc5, 0xa9, 0xe2, 0x22, 0xd8, 0xb5, 0x73, 0xf1, 0x92, 0x28, 0xb2, 0xbf, 0x90, 0x5a, 0x76, 0x77,
        0xfc, 0xa6, 0xb3, 0x21, 0x90, 0xda, 0x6f, 0xb5, 0xcf, 0x38] #taken from .data section of the file
for i in range(28):
    res.append(recurrence(i * i, table))
for i in range(28):
    print(chr(res[i] ^ flag[i]), end='')
```
We added an and mask (& 255) to consider only one byte and a list (table) with the purpose of storing known results. With these changes the recurrence ends without problems and we obtain the flag!

## Peeb Poob

>Computers usually go beep boop, but I found this weird computer that goes peeb poob.

This time another ELF file, "peeb_poob" that seems to be not executable on x86-64 architectures. The only useful thing we can do is to take a look at the decompiled code in Ghidra.

![main](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/main_2.png)

The main appears to be simple: the user can enter a string as input, which is firstly encoded and then compared char by char with a group of bytes stored in the .data section. So basically we have the encoded flag and the function used for the encoding.

![encode](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/encode.png)

One way to solve the problem is to understand how the encoding function works and based on that to derive the flag. But in a situation like this my lazy brain can only thinks about one thing: bruteforce.

![me thinking about bruteforce](/assets/img/UTCTF_2021/bruteforce.gif)


I copied the `encode(guess)` function in python and I checked that the encoding of "utflag{" corresponded to the bytes stored in the program. Perfect match! Then I built the flag starting from "utflag{" and bruteforcing it char by char. Not really elegant but certainly functional.

```python
import string

def encode(string):
    length = len(string)
    uVar1 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < length:
        uVar1 = (i < 0)
        uVar1 = ((i ^ -uVar1) + uVar1 & 3 ^ -uVar1) + uVar1
        if uVar1 < 4:
            if uVar1 == 0:
                string[i] = chr(ord(string[i]) ^ 0x21)
            if uVar1 == 1:
                string[i] = chr(ord(string[i]) ^ 7)
            if uVar1 == 2:
                string[i] = chr(ord(string[i]) ^ 0x23)
            if uVar1 == 3:
                string[i] = chr(ord(string[i]) ^ 5)
        if i + 1 < length:
            string[i + 1] = chr(ord(string[i]) ^ ord(string[i + 1]))
        i = i + 1
    return string


x = ['u', 't', 'f', 'l', 'a', 'g', '{']
enc = [0x54, 0x27, 0x62, 0x0b, 0x4b, 0x2b, 0x73, 0x14, 0x06, 0x32, 0x61, 0x3b, 0x78, 0x4f, 0x5c, 0x29, 0x57, 0x20, 0x30,
       0x06, 0x45, 0x1d, 0x4e, 0x7b, 0x6a, 0x0f, 0x51, 0x5e, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]
for k in range(20):
    for i in string.printable:
        y = x.copy()
        y.append(i)
        y = encode(y)
        if y[7 + k] == chr(enc[7 + k]):
            x.append(i)
            print("".join(x))
            break
```

We are given a series of emojis, curly brackets and underscores. Those are aranged in a way such that it's pretty easy to recognize a flag disguised as a sequence of emojis. It's also intuitive to recognize that every letter of the flag is encoded with an emoji that rapresents an animal/object which has as first letter of its name as the above-mentioned letter.
In order to decrypt the flag, the only thing we have to do is to replace every emoji with the first letter of its name (for clarity's sake I've substituted every emoji with it's name and capitalized and bolded the first letter):
