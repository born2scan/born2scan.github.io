As soon as I read the title and the description of the challenge, I immediately thought of an implementation of AES with affine sbox and the related attack that I had already seen in a previous ctf. The source code confirmed my hypotesis:
```python
    sbox = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]
```
I will briefly try to explain how the attack works (referring to [this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20228/consequences-of-aes-without-any-one-of-its-operations/70107#70107)), but please have mercy, I'm not a mathematician.

![Me doing math](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/chill-math.gif){: .image-50 } 

In the AES encryption we have 3 operations: Sub_bytes, Mix_columns, Shift_rows. The last two are linear transformations, but Sub_bytes is not. Then we also have for each AES round an AddRoundKey operation which is just a vector addiction. Constant addiction and linear transformations are both affine transformations.
Therefore Sub_bytes it is the only thing that prevents AES from being linear and, consequently, affine. \\
How can we verify if the Sub_bytes operation is linear? We need to check if the sbox is linear. In this challenge is trivial, but generally we can check that the following equation holds:

$$
Sbox[x] \oplus Sbox[y] = Sbox[x \oplus y] \oplus c
$$

for any x and y, with c constant. In this challenge we have that:

$$
Sbox[x]=x \Rightarrow Sbox[x] \oplus Sbox[y] = x \oplus y = Sbox[x \oplus y]
$$

Which is valid for every x and y, with constant c=0.  \\
Now how the affinity of AES helps us to break it? The affine transformation of the affine AES is $c = Ap \cdot k$ where `p` is the plaintext input (a vector of 128 bits), `c` is the corresponding ciphertext output, `k` is a constant vector (depends on the key) and `A` is a 128 × 128 bit matrix. It turns out the if AES is affine `A` can be precomputed so the only unknown in the previous equation is `k`. \\
We only need a single known plaintext/ciphertext block pair `(p,c)` to be able to determine `k` ($k = c − Ap$) and decrypt/encrypt whatever we want. Luckily the challenge let us encrypt arbitrary text so it's not difficult to find such a pair `(p,c)`. The following is the implementation of the attack I used, I apologize for my lazyness but I recycled the script made by the creator of a similiar challenge ([credits to him](https://github.com/SunshineCTF/SunshineCTF-2022-Public/tree/master/Crypto/AESChall)).

At the beginning I felt a bit overwhelmed by all these functions and I started to analyze them and think to complex mathematical solutions.

![Me doing math again](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/doggo_math.gif){: .image-50 }

After a while I realized that the solution might have been simpler than I thought. \\
If we think about it, the only thing that matters is that our provided input passes the check function:

```python
def check(array, mod, width):
    for x in array[0]:
        if not (x < 4 * width or mod-x < 4 * width):
            return False
    return True

.
.
.

if check(mat_mul(secret_key, keys[index], mod), mod, width)
```

More precisely we want that our input vector multiplied by a matrix passes the check. Lets try to simplify the logic of the check function:

```python
if not (x < 4 * width or mod-x < 4 * width)
```

This means that if one of the condition inside the parenthesis is true than the argument of the if is false and therefore we win! The parameters width and mod are fixed (=6 and  =10**9+7 respectively) so we only need to have that one of these 2 costraints is always true:

```python
x < 24 
(1000000007-x) < 24 
```
So we need that the elements of the result of `our_input * matrix` are all lower than 24 or higher than 1000000007-24. The first solution that came up in my mind was to provide as input vectors of zeros to make the result of the matrix multiplication always zero, therefore < 24.

```python:solve.py
from pwn import *

r = remote('puffer.utctf.live', 8484)
logger = log.progress('Round')

for i in range(10):
    logger.status(str(i))
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', b'1')
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', b'1')
    payload = b'0 '*(10*min(i+1, 5)+1)
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', payload)

r.interactive()

The following is the code of the challenge:
```python:source.py
    #!/usr/local/bin/python

    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
    from secrets import randbits

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        alice = rsa.generate_private_key(public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048)
        print("Alice's pk: ", alice.public_key().public_numbers().n, alice.public_key().public_numbers().e)
        m = randbits(256)
        s = pow(m, alice.private_numbers().d, alice.public_key().public_numbers().n)
        print(m, s)
        print("Your key: ")
        n_prime = abs(int(input("n': ")))
        e_prime = abs(int(input("e': ")))
        d_prime = abs(int(input("d': ")))

        # Checks
        x = randbits(256)
        assert alice.public_key().public_numbers().n != n_prime or alice.public_key().public_numbers().e != e_prime
        assert n_prime > s
        assert pow(x, e_prime * d_prime, n_prime) == x
        assert e_prime > 1
        assert pow(s, e_prime, n_prime) == m

        with open('flag.txt', 'r') as f:
            print("Flag: " + f.read().strip())
```

The goal of the challenge is to find some "equivalent" parameters for the RSA signature wrt to the ones used by the server. We are asked to provide `N`, `e`, `d` such that:

$$
\displaylines{
	s^e \equiv m \pmod{n} \\
	x^{ed} \equiv x \pmod{n} \\
	n>s
}
$$

When I approached the challenge I didn't have clear ideas on how to solve it so I started trying some bruteforces to find the paramters. Obviously not a smart move. \\
After a few tries I took a small break from the challenge (always the turning point for me) and while I was doing something else I came up with a good idea. 
We can notice that there are no constraints on the composition of `n`, therefore it may not be the product of 2 primes. So I used a [smooth number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number), in particular the power of a small prime, as `n`. In this way it is really easy to compute the discrete logarithm modulo `n` using the Pohlig Hellman algorithm. At this point I only needed to compute the discrete_log of `m`  with base `s` to find `e` and then recover the respective `d`. \\
This procedure is not always successful for two reasons:
- The discrete_log(m, s) may not exist
- The obtained `e` can be not invertible modulo `phi(n)`, i.e. it's impossible to get `d`

Despite this the probabilties of success are still really high, and it is sufficient to run the solve script multiple times to obtain the flag.

```python:solve.py
    from pwn import *
    from sage.all import *

    while True:
        try:
            r = remote('puffer.utctf.live', 52548)

            r.recvline()
            data = r.recvline().strip().decode().split()
            m = int(data[0])
            s = int(data[1])

            # n crafting
            prime = random_prime(2**10)
            n = prime**250
            while n < s:
                n *= prime

            s = Mod(s, n)
            # this discrete log may not exist
            e = discrete_log(m, s)
            phi = euler_phi(n)

            # if this is not true the inverse of e doesn't exist
            assert gcd(e, phi) == 1

            d = pow(e, -1, euler_phi(n))

            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(n).encode())
            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(e).encode())
            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(d).encode())
            r.interactive()
            r.close()
            break
        except:
            pass
```
